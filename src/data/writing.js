      text: "The academic Rob Nixon suggests that we live in ‘an era of enclaved time wherein for many speed has become a self-justifying, propulsive ethic that renders ‘uneventful’ violence … a weak claimant on our time’ (Nixon 8). As such, he argues ‘one of the most pressing challenges of our age is how to adjust to our rapidly eroding attention spans’, and prevent representations of conflict, which for one reason or another, fail to catch our attention (8).\n Indeed, images and stories of atrocity, are increasingly viewed with a passivity that is the consequence of over exposure, and a lack of expected engagement on the part of the reader and viewer. Sontag has expressed: ‘images of suffering endured in war are so widely disseminated now that it is easy to forget how recently such images became what is expected from photographers of note’. How then, is conflict and trauma represented, when the audience it is intended for, is characterised by a distinct inability to react, and a ‘compassion’, which ‘stretched to its limits, is going numb’ (Sontag).\n Marianne Hirsch and Linda Hutcheon both point towards comics as a medium which, in its existence at ‘the borders between the pictorial and the linguistic’, and the crossroads of different genres, demands reader participation and comprehension. The relationship between word and image in graphic novels, is not always seamless or complementary, and indeed, often demands critical engagement. Hirsch says that ‘words, images, and word-images’ placed together in graphic texts ‘enact the impossibility of seeing and the impossibility of not looking’, and that by asking ‘us to read back and forth’ they reveal ‘the materiality of words and the discursivity and narrativity of images’ (Hirsch 120).\n In Maus then, the relationship between image and text is used by Spiegelman to engage the reader with the plurality and constructedness of narrative accounts on the Holocaust. And in The Photographer and Palestine, words, photographs, and graphics, are juxtaposed in a parodic way, so as to encourage reader scrutiny in the narritavising of others’ stories. In short, this chapter intends to explore the ways in which ‘visual-verbal biocularity’ works to facilitate reader participation in narrative, and prevent the desensitization which has come to define representations of conflict (120).\nIn The Politics of Postmodernism (1989) Hutcheon explains how ‘text/image combinations work to point to the coded nature of all cultural messages. They do so by overtly being re-visions: they offer a second seeing, through double vision, wearing the spectacles of irony’ (123). Indeed, looking at the relationship between word and image, in reference to Roland Barthes, Hutcheon notes how ‘the addition of a linguistic message’ to a photograph or image, can either function as an ‘anchorage’ or a ‘relay’. Using the term anchorage, she implies a process whereby words or text can ‘fix’ an image, and ‘guide identification or interpretation’. But alternatively, she looks at how ‘the verbal in combination with the visual’ can ‘create a situation where there is double meaning and contradiction’, or what Barthes terms ‘relay’ (125).\n In comics, we sometimes see this latter relationship between word and image, and ‘above all’ the medium works to ‘de-naturalize the relation between the visual and the verbal and also any evaluative privileging of one over the other’ (125).\n Indeed, the contradiction between word and image, or the concept of ‘double vision’, is importantly used by Spiegelman in Maus to engage the reader with questions of representation, explicitly asking them to make judgements about the visual and verbal choices in the text for themselves. One obvious example of this is when Artie is questioning his father’s testimony that there was no orchestra playing as prisoners marched out of Auschwitz. The verbal account begins: ‘I just read about the camp orchestra that played as you marched out the gate’, to which Vladek responds: ‘An orchestra? … No. At the gate I heard only guards shouting’ (Spiegelman 214).\n While the reader would normally expect Spiegelman’s visual narrative to comply with the witness testimony; in the adjacent frames, we see a depiction of the orchestra, with marching prisoners, and another frame in which the prisoners cover the orchestra, except from the fingerboard of the cello, and the top of the conductor’s baton. Spiegelman wants to highlight that his father’s account of the Holocaust is not the only version of events, and that ‘it’s very well documented’, that there was an orchestra in Auschwitz. As such, he visualizes both versions of events, leaving the reader in a position in which they have to construct which narrative they wish to take forward (214). \n In an interview Spiegelman states that ‘instead of making comics into a narcotic, I’m trying to make comics that can wake you up, like caffeine comics that get you back in touch with things that are happening around you’ (Silverblatt 31). Through his presentation of this ‘double vision’, whereby the verbal narrative contradicts the visual medium, Spiegelman thus encourages the reader to make choices, and engage with the construction of the text.\n This participatory model of reading, is facilitated by visual-verbal hybridity, and indeed, prevents a reading response which is detached from the events being depicted Scott McCloud further comments on the interaction between different semiotic modes in comics, saying the overlap between the visual and verbal casts the reader into a space which exist in ‘the limbo of the gutter’, and where ‘a kind of magic’ happens that ‘only comics can create’ (McCloud 66, 92).\n  Indeed, it has often been observed that when reading a comic, the reader takes the words and images on the page and fuses them together to create their own particular narrative. Spiegelman, in an interview articulates this feature, saying: ‘I didn’t want people to get too interested in the drawing. I wanted them to be there, but the story operates somewhere else. It operates somewhere between the words and the idea that’s in the pictures and in the movement between the pictures’ (Brown 104).\n  As such, visual-verbal hybridity in comics, forces the reader into a position, in which they have to construct the series of historic and traumatic events in their own head, and are prevented from a superficial engagement. In order to achieve this effect in Maus, Spiegelman strips down the visual panels in his story to their bare essentials, presenting the reader with figures, whose expressions are conveyed in relatively few lines, and settings, in which a sense of place is constructed using minimal detail; like the small dotted wallpaper to convey the period. And verbally, Spiegelman says, he had to ‘distill’ his father’s accounts ‘to keep the phrases that are most telling’ (Brown 96).\n This economic approach to using words and image on the page, forces the reader to participate in the process of narrative reconstruction independently, or as McCloud says, it encourages the ‘phenomenon of observing the parts but perceiving the whole’ (McCloud 63).\n Andreas Huyssen explains this imaginative participation is what lead to the success of Peter Weiss’ post-war play about the Holocaust, The Investigation (1965). He says: ‘Auschwitz is not shown on stage; it is recreated through the memory of the accused, the witnesses and survivors who confront each other a second time in the courtroom trying to testify and to articulate what happened another time at another place’ (Huyssen, The Politics of Identification 131).\n In a similar way to the graphic novel, Weiss’ play refuses a representation of the tragedy of Auschwitz in a complete visually digestible way, instead it asks the viewer, or audience, to construct for themselves, through hearing the memories ‘of the accused’, the events, imaginatively on their own terms.\n Claude Lanzmann’s Shoa (1985), a much praised film dealing with the events of the Holocaust, must also be referenced here. The film is ‘made exclusively of testimonies: first-hand testimonies of participants in the historical experience of the Holocaust, interviewed and filmed by Lanzmann’, and ‘in contrast to its cinematic predecessors on the subject, it refuses systematically to use any historical, archival footage’ (Felman 205). As such, the audience is asked to engage in the process of the reconstruction of events imaginatively themselves, and encouraged to contemplate questions on the limits of visual representation, and what it means to engage with the suffering of others.\n While Maus offers a visual as well as a verbal account of the events of the Holocaust, and is therefore not completely comparable with Shoa or The Investigation, the overlap between image and text, forces the reader into a space in which they too are partly responsible for constructing the events. Indeed, Hutcheon says that Maus creates a ‘fictive heterocosm, a complete visual and verbal universe’, and as such, the reader is forced into a position where they are required to participate in this ‘universe’, and prevented from a desensitization to the suffering of others (Hutcheon, Postmodern Provocation 301).\n With further regard to word-image relationships, Hutcheon observes that when there is friction between the two, we sometimes see, what she terms ‘parodic intertextuality’ (Hutcheon, The Politics of Postmodernism 61). Or that, ‘the clashing of various possible’ narrative discourses (word and image) creates a ‘parodic’ situation, which challenges the reader’s ‘assumption of the seamlessness’ of narrative, and asks us to ‘question the process by which we represent’ (53). Indeed, in this sense, as she rightly points out, ‘postmodern parody is both deconstructively critical and constructively creative, paradoxically making us aware of both the limits and the power of representation’ (98).\n Its ‘constructively creative’ use can be seen especially well in Sacco’s Palestine, where he juxtaposes visual with verbal, to create parodic situations in his narrative, in which the reader is forced engage with the constructedness of his portrayal of others’ stories. In Ways of Seeing (1972) John Berger explains that ‘the meaning of an image is changed according to what one sees immediately beside it or what comes immediately after it’ (Berger 29). Throughout Sacco’s text, there are moments where he presents a panel, signifying one thing to the reader, but then sharply undermines or contradicts this through his verbal narration. As such, he changes the meaning of the image, as Berger argues, is a vulnerability of the visual medium, but he also creates a parodic situation, where the reader is forced to question his narrative authority.\n One particular example of this is when Sacco is in a hospital ward, and he sees a mother at the bedside of her injured son. The verbal narration says: ‘Ask her if I can take his picture’, to which the mother’s response is: ‘‘No’ in Arabic’ (Sacco 32). The visual frames presented, however, directly oppose the verbal, and laid across the page are two vivid graphic renditions of the injured son, teeth clenched together in pain. Considering how much Sacco uses photographic evidence for his non-photographic drawings – Katalin Orbán says ‘he relies on photos for the authentic recreation of scenes’ -  we can assume that he took the photograph of the injured boy, disobeying the mother (Orbán 131). The visual and verbal therefore clash, as Hutcheon says is typical of postmodern parody, and the effect is that the reader is forced to linger on the narrative account given by Sacco and subject it to criticism. \n As such, the reader participates in the process by which the narrative account is brought into being, and are far less likely to overlook, as Nixon explains is typical of representation of violence, the suffering of others. In the whole of Palestine, there is only one full page-spread not accompanied by verbal narration. Berger explains in relation to paintings unaccompanied by words, that they ‘are silent and still in a sense that information never is’ (Berger 31). Sacco’s inclusion of this one un-narrativised drawing, can be seen as a reminder of how powerfully his words influence the images in his story, and again, how as the reader, we should be constantly critical of where word and image meet to convey meaning.\n In The Photographer too, Orbán notes how ‘parodic-intertextuality’ encourages reader engagement with the narrative presented by Lefèvre (Hutcheon, The Politics of Postmodernism 61). She says: ‘the reading process is a very dynamic sequence of dizzying displacements’ and that ‘panelized contact strips significantly shift the logic of organization, status, and mode of viewing’ (Orbán 133). Indeed, the use of photographic, graphic and verbal narration, all interweaving with one another, prevent a seamless reading of events, but instead form an ordered chaos, laid out on the page, which the reader is required to make sense of.\n Thus, while Nancy Pedri looks at the relationship between word and image in The Photographer, saying ‘that which the photographs present visually restates and expands upon the verbal text’ and in this way ‘the two work together as equal partners in the creation of meaning’ (Pedri 17). It is more the case, that while words contextualize, and provide the images with definition (as explained in chapter one), this not an immediately intuitive process, but requires work and multimodal forms of reading.\n For example, having been invited to have a look at an injured girl who ‘hasn’t gotten up since the bombing’, Lefèvre provides the reader with a detailed verbal narrative account of the girl’s injuries, he says: ‘There’s no apparent wound. No Blood’ but ‘that little dot, there … that means she’ll never walk again’ (Lefèvre 134, 135). Due to the darkness of the room, however, Lefèvre doesn’t take any photographs, all the reader is left to observe, is graphic panels which depict the silhouettes of figures surrounding the little girl in the dark. And, in the later frames, when the girl has been taken out on a stretcher, the reader still, is only presented with photographs of a group of people, but never an image of the girl herself.\n As such, the reader is placed in a position, in which they have to thread together the disharmonious verbal narrative with the photographic, and non-photographic panels, to create for themselves, a rounded picture of the injuries which Lefèvre describes. The visual and verbal in this situation, do not match up, and the reader is left with a parodic situation, in which they have to tie the different mediums together in a logical way, thus personally contributing to the narratavising of the paralyzed girl’s story.\n Hutcheon says that the ‘conjunction of text and image raises new questions’ about representation in postmodern literature, and indeed, in The Photographer, we see how the two, in juxtaposition to one another, encourage and facilitate reader participation in the conflict experienced by others.In reference then, to what Sontag and Nixon say with regards to an increasing desensitization towards images and stories of conflict due to ‘rapidly eroding attention spans’ (Nixon 3)."

      text: "One of the major challenges of representing the suffering experienced by others is that normal chronological temporalities are often disrupted, and can become fragmentary and disorientating. In order to give expression to others’ pain then, writers are often forced to find innovative and creative ways to give figurative shape to the temporal confusion which is resultant when conflict is experienced or translated into words. The graphic novel, in the complex architecture of its pages, where a sense of time is created through the spatial layout of individual panels, allows for these complex temporalities to be represented. Indeed, Thierry Groensteen, a prominent comics theorist, has highlighted the unique way in which time operates in graphic novels, saying: ‘the position of a panel in the page corresponds to a particular moment in the unfolding of the story’ and that ‘each new panel hastens the story and, simultaneously, holds it back’ (Groensteen 35). As such, the writer of the graphic novel is able to manipulate the unfolding of time, and present it in the fragmentary and juxtaposing ways necessary for the representation of conflict. Scott McCloud, whose comics theory, this chapter will use along with Groensteen’s, has similarly articulated this as the way ‘panels fracture both time and space, offering a jagged staccato rhythm of unconnected moments’ (McCloud 67). In Maus Spiegelman uses this feature of the graphic novel to convey the way in which victims of trauma, like his father Vladek, experience the past and present as complicatedly entwined with one another. Lefèvre’s The Photographer is similarly able to unpack the difficult temporalities of photographs of conflict. Through the careful composition of both graphic and photographic panels on the page, he encourages the reader to ‘stop looking at photographs and instead start watching’ them (Azoulay 14). And finally, Sacco’s Palestine utilises the graphic novel’s spatio-topical system to convey the way in which Palestinians are victims of ‘slow violence’, a term Rob Nixon uses to refer to violence which has been rendered invisible due to the passing of time (Nixon 3). In short then, this chapter is an exploration into the ways in which the complex temporalities of violence and conflict, are productively represented in the graphic novel due to its unique temporal-spatial system. It is well established among trauma theorists, that in many cases, victims of trauma experience little distance between a moment of past suffering and the present. Ernst Van Alphen, for example, has noted how survivors of the Holocaust are susceptible to traumatic re-enactment, whereby ‘the original traumatic event has not yet been transformed into a mediated, distanced account’ but rather ‘re-imposes itself in its visual and sensory directness’ (Van Alphen 211). In its careful juxtaposition of past and present, Maus has been praised by numerous literary critics for the innovative and accurate way in which it portrays the experience of trauma victims as bound to their past. Andreas Huyssen has commented on how ‘historical and personal trauma’ are effectively ‘knotted together’ in the story, and Rosemary Hathaway has written about the way in which the ‘text reveals how powerfully the past influences the present’ (Huyssen, Of Mice and Mimesis 71) (Hathaway 250). Indeed, through his manipulation of the features of the graphic novel, Spiegelman is able to partly overcome the difficulty of representing the temporal complexity of trauma. In an interview, he states that comics are ‘about time being made manifest spatially’, and that this allows him to juxtapose past and present to depict ‘different times inhabiting the same space’ (Silverblatt 35) This device is used throughout the text, but is perhaps most effectual in a scene where Vladek is telling Artie about an incident in 1931, when the Germans ‘took four Jews away for dealing goods without coupons’, and made an example of them by leaving them to hang for ‘one full week’ on ‘Modrezejowska Street’ (Spiegelman 85). Spiegelman first emphasises the length of ‘one full week’ by providing one large frame containing a full picture of the hung Jews, followed by two smaller frames, which show only their dangling feet. The two smaller panels are separated by what Scott McCloud calls ‘moment-to-moment’ closure, whereby ‘very little’ action occurs between the frames (McCloud 74). The effect of this, is that the reader is forced to linger on the scene, and slow their pace of reading. In positioning the panels at the bottom right of the page, Spiegelman further uses what comic theorists term, a turn-page-reveal, which allows for a dramatic change of rhythm or scene on the next page. Indeed, Spiegelman presents three panels which depict a conversation between Artie and Vladek in present-time, where Vladek says: ‘Ach. When I think now of them, it still makes me cry […] look even from my dead eye tears are coming out’ (Spiegelman 86). Using the spatio-topical system of the graphic novel, Spiegelman thus juxtaposes past: the lingering frames depicting the four hung Jews, and present: Vladek becoming emotional at the memory. The ultimate effect, is that the reader is forced to consider the way in which for Vladek, this traumatic event is not ‘transformed into a mediated, distanced account’, but rather it exists in ‘visual and sensory directness’ (Van Alphen 211).\n In an essay on memory Aledia Assman has further commented on the way in which, for victims of trauma, memory is often ‘acquired by collective instruction, it is the site of continuous learning and acquisition of both general and specialized knowledge’ (Assman 36). She proposes that the individual does not always ‘preserve an original stimulus’ but rather creates their past through a ‘process of continuous re-inscription and reconstruction’ (39). In this sense traumatic timelines are not a string of linear events but a self-conception which depends on multiple different sources and fragmented temporalities. In Maus Spiegelman represents this model of traumatic memory, as he says, by ‘giving form to his father’s words and narrative’ through ‘panel size, panel rhythms, and visual structures on the page’ (Chute, The shadow of a past time 200). Indeed, the comics medium, in its composition using ‘interdependent images’, which when placed together create meaning, allow for multiple narrative voices, and sources to be individually presented on the page. Groensteen explains this in other words, saying: ‘the page is divided into randomly sectioned fragments’ which are ordered ‘according to an architectural perspective’ (Groensteen 34). As such, the process by which a traumatic memory, based on ‘re-inscription and ‘reconstruction’ is created, can be effectively presented in the graphic novel. When Artie is asking Vladek about the ‘bunkers’ that he had to build in order to avoid capture by the Germans, the memory is created by Spiegelman through a combination of both Vladek’s words, and a sketch which he draws. Vladek says: ‘I arranged for us a very good hiding spot in our cellar, where it was coal storage … show to me your pencil and I can explain’ (Spiegelman 112). The memory of the ‘bunker’ is therefore represented by Spiegelman as heterogeneous: one half of the double-page shows a visual rendering of the bunker, and above, Vladek’s verbal narrative account of how he built it. On the following page, Spiegelman combines the two sources and incorporates it into his more complete narrative account of Vladek’s experience while in the Srodula Ghetto. The comics medium therefore allows Spiegelman to show the way in which memory is an architectural formation, and subject to constant ‘reconstruction’. Indeed, towards the end of Maus while Artie is asking Vladek about his release from Auschwitz, Vladek states: ‘all such things of the war, I tried to put out from my mind once and for all … until you rebuild me all this from your questions’ (258). Time in Maus is therefore represented a series of fragmented moments, which more accurately depict the way in which memory and trauma are experienced. It is only through the form of the graphic novel, with its sense of temporality being created through juxtaposing panels, that Spiegelman is so effectively able to show this.\n In a similar way to how Maus uses the graphic novel to represent the difficult temporalities of trauma and memory, in The Photographer Lefèvre attempts to overcome the atemporality of war photography to illicit a more emotional response from the viewer. Ariella Azoulay has argued that ‘photography is much more than what is printed on the photographic paper. The photograph bears the seal of the photographic event, and reconstructing this event requires more than just identifying what is shown in the photograph’ (Azoulay 14). Susan Sontag, however, has pointed out that in most cases a photograph ‘flares up, is shared by many people, and fades from view’, and our mode of looking, whether or not we mean it to be, becomes an act of voyeurism (Sontag). How then, as Azoulay notes, do we start ‘watching’ photographs, and reinscribe them with a sense of temporality that encourages the reader to engage with the conflict that they depict.\n In The Photographer Lefèvre places his photographs of Afghanistan in amongst non-photographic panels, thereby narrativising them and reconstructing their complex temporality on the page. In a village called Püstük, which ‘has been spared by … bombs’, Lefèvre photographs many injured civilians, and on one particular page of the graphic novel, he enlarges a picture of a badly injured boy of ‘maybe two or three’ (Lefèvre 129, 132). Looking at the photograph, the reader can extrapolate that the boy is injured, but not how badly, and the identity of the girl beside him (perhaps his mother) cannot be known. It is a powerful photograph, but it is almost impossible to establish its timeline. Teju Cole suggests this is common of photographs of war, where there are often questions which are ‘hard to answer only by looking at the photograph’ (Cole). Through the comics medium, however, Lefèvre provides the photograph with a sense of movement. In the preceding panels, he shows the sounds the boy is making: ‘a little wail of aoh’, and a few pages later, we learn from Juliette, of the child’s death. She exclaims: ‘He must have had internal bleeding’ and ‘the mother said to me, ‘film it, Jamilia. People have to know’’ (Lefèvre 136). Scott McCloud, has argued that comics force the ‘human imagination’ to take ‘two separate images and transform them into a single idea’ (McCloud 67). What Lefèvre is achieving then, by accompanying his photographs with non-photographic panels, is a sense of narrative, or ‘single idea’, which allows the reader, or viewer, to overcome the atemporality of photographs, and engage with the suffering experienced by the people in them. Indeed, Susan Sontag has noted that ‘to photograph is to frame, and to frame is to exclude’ and that ‘narrative seems likely to be more effective than an image’ (Sontag). The graphic novel can therefore be seen partly as a solution on how to take a photograph, and inscribe it with a sense of time, as Azoulay says, to establish that it represents more than just a piece of paper, but the real-life suffering of other individuals.\n The comics medium further allows for time to expand or contract depending on the layout of panels on the page. Or more specifically, as Groensteen points out, ‘a panel is not presented as isolated. It participates in a series (most often sequential, or narrative) offered to the reader’, and it is up to the writer to determine the rhythm of reading, depending on the placement of these panels (Groensteen 47, 61). This feature of the graphic novel is utilized by Lefèvre to engage the reader in specific moments of conflict depicted in his photographs. He prevents them being viewed as static, and reinscribes them with a particular sense of time. Indeed, Nancy Pedri has commented on this in her analysis of the The Photographer, saying ‘the temporal implications of the photographic sequence are restated and the narrative details expanded upon’ (Pedri). This is especially apparent, in a sequence of images presented of a man with a minor wound, which the narrative introduces: ‘that’s a scene I’ve seen a hundred times in the movies: the hero takes a swig of whisky bites down on a piece of wood, and aaarh! They extract the bullet with pliers in one sharp tug … the truth is that the whole things is excruciatingly painful’ (Lefèvre 128). In order to convey the pain the individual feels, Lefèvre presents multiple frames, in quick succession, in the form of a photographic test-sheet. Normally, in comics, as Groensteen explains, ‘the eye’s movement on the surface of the page are relatively erratic and do not respect any precise protocol’, here however, the uniformed presentation of individual panels, forces the reader to engage with the particular incident, and experience a slowing down of time (Groensteen 47). The ‘breathing’ of the reader becomes ‘affected’, and as such, it is possible to reflect more carefully on the conflict the pictures represent (61). Throughout The Photographer a red wax marker is used to indicate the individual exposures from amongst Lefèvre’s test-sheets, which he would have chosen to develop. This is a constant reminder for the reader, that without the contextualization of these photographs using the graphic novel’s distinctive paneling system as a means of creating a sense of time and narrative; these photographs, and the people in them, would be assigned to a temporal void. Indeed, Susan Sontag has pointed out how photography supposedly act as an authentic claim or evidence to the fact that something has happened, but she also notes: ‘evidence of what?’. This, we cannot know, unless, as The Photographer shows, the reader is provided with a narrativised and temporal accompaniment to a photograph.  As such, the comics medium, can be seen to endow photographs with movement, through the layout of the panels spatially across a page, and encourage a genuine engagement with the suffering experienced by others.\n Overcoming the difficult temporalities of others’ suffering is also an issue in Sacco’s graphic novel: Palestine. Indeed, In Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor (2011) Rob Nixon uses the term ‘slow violence’ to refer to ‘a violence of delayed destruction that is dispersed across time and space’ (Nixon 2). He explains that not all violence is ‘immediate in time, explosive and spectacular’ but sometimes it occurs gradually and out of sight where ‘casualties are postponed, often for generations’. How then, he asks, is this violence represented, or in other words, how are ‘arresting stories, images, and symbols adequate to the pervasive but elusive violence of delayed effects’ constructed (3). This is a challenge Sacco faces in representing the suffering experienced by Palestinians. Indeed, in the introduction to the book, Edward Said notes that Sacco is confronted with the task of representing a suffering which has its origins firmly grounded in a much overlooked and largely invisible history. He refers to the famous statement made by Golda Meir in the Sunday Times in 1969, in which she said: there was ‘no such thing as Palestinians … it was not as though there was a Palestinians people in Palestine considering itself as a Palestinians people’ (Parmenter 20). Thus, Sacco’s Palestine is an attempt to accomplish, through the manipulation of the graphic novel’s spatio-topical system, a reimaging of the violence which currently effects Palestinians, but which also has its origins in the past. In the first chapter, for example, Sacco spatially apposes two pages: one on which a Palestinian refugee in Jabilia tells the story of how his family were forced to flee in 1948, saying ‘The Jews came and occupied the village and arrested everyone left behind …  It was a black day when I left my land’ (Sacco 15). The other page depicts a Jewish American, who says: ‘Well I’m actually American but this feels like home to me’, with Sacco’s interjection about the American: ‘he’s got full Israeli citizenship if he wants, that’s the Law of Return, any Jew from anywhere can ‘return here’’ (14). On two pages then, which the reader can view all at one, Sacco shows the tragedy of the Palestinian situation. While the American-Jew, who has never been to the region before, can claim citizenship, the Palestinian, disposed in 1948, still remains a refugee. Hilary Chute expresses of Sacco’s work that it ‘strives to materialize visually an archive of oral testimony … reconstructing the bodies of others, bodies that have been ignored by official discourse’ (Chute, Comics Form and Narrating Lives 112). Indeed, on this double page, Sacco is able to contrast two different temporal situations (the American’s and the Palestinian’s), to highlight the fact that Palestinians still suffer the consequences of dispossession, even if unseen, while Israel moves on. In short then, he gives form to the invisible suffering of Palestinians, which Nixon explains is characteristic of ‘slow violence’, through his manipulation and juxtaposition of panels in his graphic novel.\n Talking about comics, Federico Fellini says that ‘more than film’, they benefit ‘from the collaboration of the readers: one tells them a story that they tell to themselves; with their particular rhythm and imagination, in moving forward and backward’ (Groensteen 11). Indeed, using the graphic novel, the writer can ask the reader to imagine time not as linear and chronological, but instead, as something constructed on the page. Through the placement of individual panels spatially, time can be fragmented, and manipulated so as to accommodate more complicated temporal situations. In representing the violence and pain experienced by others, normal temporalities, as this chapter has explained, are disorientated. The graphic-novel’s temporal spatial system, which allows for more flexibility, is thus used in Maus, The Photographer and Palestine in order to better engage their readers with the duration of conflict represented in their respective texts."

    text: "In representing the conflict and pain experienced by others there is a danger of becoming a voyeur, a tourist of suffering, or at least a propagator of false information. A large question therefore resides in the moral implications of representing the misfortune of others, especially if it is done from a position of privilege. Rob Nixon has written extensively on the role of the ‘writer activist’, which he describes as category of writers that embrace the ‘challenges of translating across chasms of class, race, gender, and nation’, and who ‘are enraged by injustices they wish to see redressed’. He asks how these writers engage with global violations while also challenging their own privilege, or in his words, the ‘privilege of the visible’. Indeed, in representing the pain experienced by others, especially through literary means, writers must acknowledge their fortunate place, at a distance from the suffering they wish to expose. This article therefore intends to explore the ways in which the graphic novel attempts to overcome the moral problematics of representing others’ pain. Linda Hutcheon explains that a defining characteristic of postmodern writing is that it is ‘premised on a challenge to the realist notion of representation that presumes transparency of the medium’, and a self-reflexivity that acknowledges the shortcomings of narrative authority. Spiegelman, Lefèvre and Sacco all employ postmodern metafictional components in their work as a way of drawing attention to the constructedness of their respective narrative accounts. In Maus metafiction is used by Spiegelman to abandon any claims that his graphic novel is an exhaustive account on the events of the Holocaust. Lefèvre’s The Photographer similarly employs postmodern devices as a means of drawing attention to his role as a naïve, Western photographer in Afghanistan. And in Palestine, Sacco frequently makes reference to his own impartiality, and the incompleteness of his narrative reportage while in the region. \n The historian Dominik LaCapra observes that in representing the Holocaust, outside the role of the witness, there is a danger in venturing towards morally insensitive stylistic excess. Or more specifically, that in the reconstruction of traumatic events, often in the form of fiction or art, there is a tendency to do so in ‘terms of an insufficiently differentiated, rashly generalized, hyperbolic aesthetic of the sublime’. Schindler’s List (1994) directed by Steven Spielberg, or even the more recent work by László Nemes, Son of Saul (2015) illustrate this aesthetic excess, or what LaCapra terms the ‘dubious consequence’ of representation. Indeed, the aestheticized treatment of the Holocaust in both of these films, some critics argue, takes away from the real trauma of the event. Comparing the two, Stefan Grissemann has asserted that while Nemes’ ‘art-house experiment refuses sentimentality and character identification’ making it the ‘antitheses of Spielberg’s Holocaust’, Son of Saul ‘remains at a distance from the reality it reaches for’. Literary critic, Andreas Huyssen, has similarly observed the way in which the culture industry, in the aftermath of the Holocaust, tended towards ‘Brechtian parable plays’, which abstracted the traumatic events with the intention of creating a ‘distance’ from which spectators could develop a rational understanding of the Holocaust. However, the ‘avant-gardist’ approach towards representation, Huyssen argues was ‘ironic’, for while it ‘enabled playwrights to attack the Third Reich’ it also ‘prevented audience identification with the historic specificity of Jewish suffering’. Like the Brechtian plays of the 1950s, Art Spiegelman’s Maus uses cats and mice allegorically to tell the story of Jewish persecution at the hands of Nazi Germany. The novel, with its visual components and heavily stylized pages, is therefore positioned dangerously close to the cinematic experimentation of Spielberg and Nemes. However, the metafictional components included in Maus are utilized by Spiegelman to abandon any claims of totality of representation, and through showing the processes he worked through in publishing Maus, the novel party resolves the issue of representing others’ pain. \n Hilary Chute argues that ‘the most metafictional section’ of Maus is the chapter ‘Time Flies’ which allows Spiegelman to reflect on the ‘viability’ of his ‘present project’. Indeed, the first page opens with Art wearing a mouse mask, looking towards the reader saying: ‘In September 1986, after 8 years of work, the first part of Maus was published. It was a critical and commercial success’. In wearing the mask, Spiegelman is confessing to his concerns about profiteering from the suffering of so many deaths (it suggests he is only pretending to be Jewish), and in the next frame we see him at his drawing board, looking conscious-stricken, with a pile of bodies underneath his chair. The inclusion of himself in the narrative, discussing the book we are reading, allows Spiegelman to tackle directly, any claims that Maus attempts at a transparency of events, or a complete authentic account of the Holocaust. Indeed, as the chapter progresses, Art is asked by multiple journalists about the success of his book: ‘tell our viewers what message you want them to get’, to which his responses become increasingly desperate and confused: ‘I have no idea’, ‘Who am I to say’ and ‘Huh?’. In the course of these questions, we see the body of Art transform from a full sized adult into that of a child, who eventually screams ‘Wah … I want my mommy’ (202). In depicting himself as an infant, Spiegelman thus attempts to highlight his own distance and alienation from the Holocaust, and his acknowledgement that he cannot comprehend the entirety or complexity of the events. Later in the chapter, the infantile Spiegelman talks to his psychologist, saying: ‘My father worked in a tin shop near the camp. I have no idea what kind of tools and stuff to draw. There’s no documentation’ (206). Hathaway describes one of the major characteristics of postmodern ethnography as its tendency to ‘start from a place of defeat: how can a single account convey the dynamic, multivalent, contested nature of any cultural group or phenomenon’. In pointing out, as he does by admitting to his psychologist, that he doesn’t know what a ‘tin shop near the camp’ would have looked like, as well as consistently outlining his own narrative shortcomings, Spiegelman drops all claims of a complete and accurate representation of his father’s experience of the Holocaust. As such, metafiction is effectively used in the novel, to overcome the problematics of making an aesthetic experience, as La Capra warns, of others’ pain. \n Huyssen’s essay looking at Maus in relation to what Adorno famously claimed about representations of the Holocaust - ‘To write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric’ - further argues that Spiegelman, by drawing on comics ‘as a mass cultural genre’ and saturating his text ‘with modernist techniques of self-reflexivity’ avoids morally insensitive representation. One such technique Spiegelman uses for achieving this self-reflexivity, according to Huyssen, is the inclusion of ‘irony, shock’ and ‘black humor’ in the novel (81). Indeed, an example of this is in the section of the Maus titled ‘Prisoner of the Hell Planet: A Case History’, in which Spiegelman presents himself in highly stylized, almost wood-cut like prints, dressed in the clothing of an Auschwitz prisoner. By representing himself in such clothing, Spiegelman is ironically embracing what so many Holocaust representations attempt to avoid: over-stepping the mark, and giving too subjective a version of events which then compromise the authenticity of the historic account given. Indeed, despite having asserted in interviews that ‘I’ve never been through anything like that’, in reference to the Holocaust; by referring to himself as a victim, Spiegelman is highlighting the way in which he brings his own personal history into his representation, and his feelings of resentment at having been the child of Holocaust survivors. Huyssen has said that: ‘the memories of Auschwitz do not only claim Anja; they also envelop the son born years after the war’. On the next page of the integrated comic - Prisoner of the Hell Planet -  Spiegelman announces behind prison bars: ‘Well, mom. If you’re listening … Congratulations! You’ve committed the perfect crime … you put me here … shorted all my circuits… cut my nerve endings … and crossed my wires! ... your murdered me me. Mommy’. The referral to his mother as the ‘murderer’ is deeply ironic, considering her status as a survivor of the concentration camps, and consequential victim of suicide. Yet the inclusion of these ironic portrayals and subversions of who is victim and perpetrator, dramatically emphasises the non-objectivity of the historic account given by Spiegelman. No representation which attempts at complete transparency would venture to make the insinuation that victims of the Holocaust are ‘murderers’. Hathaway has stated that Spiegelman’s negative portrayal of himself, as we have seen in this section, is an ‘acknowledgement of the difficulty – if not the impossibility – of letting fieldwork subjects speak for themselves’. Indeed, the presentation of his father and mother’s experience of the Holocaust has the traces of his words all over it.  As such, Maus offers a representation of the Holocaust which avoids largely the moral pitfalls of depicting the suffering ‘of others, through the inclusion, and criticism of himself in the text. Or as Linda Hutcheon has noted on postmodern representational practices, Maus can be seen to ‘refuse to stay neatly within accepted conventions and traditions’, instead employing metafictional techniques which refuse ‘control and mastery’. \n The Photographer and Palestine similarly struggle with the moral challenge of representing conflict from the perspective of an outsider, or more specifically, the perspective of tourist and travel writer. This has been picked up by Monica Chiū in her essay on travel narratives and comics, in which she asserts that ‘while travel writers might be aware of […] global inequalities, they are often unaware of how the act of writing about travel itself engenders contemporary power formations that are unequal’. Indeed, in his representation of Afghani turmoil as someone from the West, Lefèvre unavoidably situates himself in the contentious and extensive debate on neo-colonial and imperializing gazes, as does Sacco in his presentation of Palestine. Linda Nochlin in The Politics of Vision (1991) outlines the West’s historic tendency to invent, through supposedly ‘objective reportage’ an image of the ‘Orient’. Through a deliberate process of selection and exclusion, she explains artists and writers have artificially constructed, in their own terms, a vision of the East as ‘Other’. To such an extent that ‘The white man, the Westerner’ is always present in depictions of the East, and that it is through his gaze that the image of the Oriental world is brought into being. In depicting the suffering of Afghani individuals, partly using the photographic medium, which Sontag explains is built to ‘frame’ and ‘exclude’, The Photographer risks falling into a long tradition, whereby artists and writers have fabricated an image of the East, which disregards the intentions of those being represented. Indeed, Sontag emphasises how some of the most ‘canonical images of early war photography turn out to have been staged, or to have had their subjects tampered with’. Similarly, in Sacco’s narrative account of Palestinian lives, he is in the privileged position of giving shape and form to others’ experiences of suffering, and in control of how their stories are translated into words. In both The Photographer and Palestine, however, Lefèvre and Sacco are careful to make use postmodern metafiction, like Spiegelman does in Maus, to overcome the potentially disastrous consequences of representing the suffering experienced by others without reinforcing and contributing to a neo-colonial rhetoric. \n Commenting on Orientalism in Western Literature, Said has pointed out the tendency to present ‘the cultural inferiority of the Islamic Orient’ and attempts to ‘perpetuate European dominance’. The Photographer and Palestine expresses an awareness of their relationship to this Western literary tradition, and take careful steps to avoid narrative mastery by detailing the short-comings of their own narrators: Lefèvre and Sacco. In an introduction to The Photographer, Alexis Siegel states ‘We discover Afghanistan through the eyes and camera of [a] photojournalist […] who is admittedly naïve about the geopolitical complexities that he is stumbling into’. Indeed, deciding to abandon the MSF trip, Lefèvre makes the journey from Afghanistan back to Pakistan, expecting the organization to provide guides to help him. On realizing that the guides he has been sent, aren’t the experienced ‘Muji’ which he has been accustomed to throughout his trip, he complains to Odile, a member of the MSF team: ‘Bassir gave me a bunch of useless creeps’, to which she responds, ‘you poor thing! … I can’t really blame him, though. He can’t afford to assign four muji to a guy who’s going back alone. He’s keeping his muji for the winter or sending them with major caravans’. The metafictional presentation of himself in The Photographer demanding special treatment, undermines Lefèvre’s narrative authority, and the reader is encouraged to consider the story and its representations as tainted by Western bias. Lefèvre’s decision to walk to Pakistan also results in a near death experience, where unable to do the most fundamental tasks, like strap luggage to his horse, he becomes stranded in the mountains. His subsequent rescue by a ‘caravan’ headed by a ‘wolf faced’ Afghani, subverts the hierarchy which presumes the Westerner has the most knowledge. Indeed, as Chiū has points out, The Photographer juxtaposes ‘the white protagonists against their non-white counterparts to ask who has power and visibility in the narrative, in which situations, and why?’. In Palestine too, Sacco is eager to point towards his own privilege in representing others’ suffering. In the chapter ‘Refugee Land’, in which he visits a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, he deliberately emphasises his position as tourist: ‘So I saw Gaza, sort of… I did the UNRWA tour, in and out in two hours’, and frequently paints himself in an unsympathetic light: ‘Tomorrow I’m going to another camp, Jabilia … I’d rather not … I’d rather sit around a heater with people like Larry and read Edward Said’.  Sacco’s text is brimming these examples, in which he comes across as insensitive, or apathetic to the hardship which he reports on. The effect is that the reader learns to distrust his narrative, or is at least encouraged to question the authority of his voice, and the claims he makes. \n In The Photographer Lefèvre frequently represents the process by which he has taken a photograph, and in Palestine too, there are constant referrals throughout the novel, to the way in which Sacco gathers sources and material for his writing. As such, both text encourage a critical engagement with their methods of representation, which contrasts the transparency characteristic of neo-colonial depictions of the East. Sontag explains that photographs have the ‘advantage of uniting two contradictory features’ in that their ‘credentials of objectivity’ are in built, but that they almost always have a ‘point of view’. Lefèvre deliberately highlights that his photographs are not objective reportage, but rather the product of his own decisions and the processes he works through. Waking up from a night’s sleep in the ‘town square of Kantiwa’, Lefèvre sees a photo opportunity, he says: ‘I know I should take a picture, but feel so empty… I fumble in my bag and weakly pull out the first camera I feel… barely frame the picture … there so be it’. On the following page we are presented with one of the most striking photographs in the novel, a picture of two tall Muji standing with a small child beneath them. The narrative account of producing the photograph, which in this incident is inattentively done, allows the reader to question the impartiality behind its creation. It bears the trace of Lefèvre’s input rather than appearing objective, which Nochlin criticizes in previous colonial depictions of the East: the absense of the artist which would ‘give credibility to the ‘realness’ of the work as a whole, to authenticate the total visual field as simple, artless reflection – in this case, of a supposed Oriental reality’. In a later incident, Lefèvre also refers to an effort made by the ‘Wakil’ to get all his men to line up in front of their barracks for a photograph. He then states: ‘all that commotion for a picture they’ll never see’. His reference to the incident, and the commentary on the picture’s creation allows Lèfevre to address one of the central problems of photographing others: the privilege of the photographer over the photographic subject, both in how the picture is created, but also the after-life of the photograph. In Palestine, this is also something Sacco draws attention towards. He highlights the subjectivity, and sometimes lack of input from his subjects, in his narrative account, by depicting the way he gathers material for his novel. In a hospital ward, we see him, camera in hand, moving around hospital beds saying: ‘I’m warming up to my photo op … I’m prowling around looking for angels’. He presents himself as very much a part of the photographic process, intruding in on others’ injuries, rather than a being a neutral by stander. We see that the way he gathers sources is not impartial, but something which very much involves his subjective input. As such, the metafictional inclusion of themselves in the narrative, as well as outlining the process by which the narrative is constructed – both distinctly postmodern techniques – allows Lefèvre and Sacco to forgo the ‘totalizing impulse’ of western literature, and takes strides towards a representation which is, morally, less questionable. \n In short then, while representing the conflict experienced by others is normally complicated by the privileged position held by the person providing the narrative account. Like artistic accounts of the Holocaust, or depictions of the East, from the perspective of an outsider, which are susceptible to acquiring a colonial gaze. In the graphic novels: Maus, The Photographer and Palestine, metafiction, and the inclusion of the author in the narration, allows for a self-reflexivity which prevents any claim at a totalizing narrative, or authorial voice. In all the texts, the reader is encouraged to mistrust the accuracy of the representation at all points of the narrative, and as such, there is an engagement with the conflict experienced by others that is not tainted by voyeurism, or moral insensitivity."
