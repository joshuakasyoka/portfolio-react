      text: "The academic Rob Nixon suggests that we live in ‘an era of enclaved time wherein for many speed has become a self-justifying, propulsive ethic that renders ‘uneventful’ violence … a weak claimant on our time’ (Nixon 8). As such, he argues ‘one of the most pressing challenges of our age is how to adjust to our rapidly eroding attention spans’, and prevent representations of conflict, which for one reason or another, fail to catch our attention (8).\n Indeed, images and stories of atrocity, are increasingly viewed with a passivity that is the consequence of over exposure, and a lack of expected engagement on the part of the reader and viewer. Sontag has expressed: ‘images of suffering endured in war are so widely disseminated now that it is easy to forget how recently such images became what is expected from photographers of note’. How then, is conflict and trauma represented, when the audience it is intended for, is characterised by a distinct inability to react, and a ‘compassion’, which ‘stretched to its limits, is going numb’ (Sontag).\n Marianne Hirsch and Linda Hutcheon both point towards comics as a medium which, in its existence at ‘the borders between the pictorial and the linguistic’, and the crossroads of different genres, demands reader participation and comprehension. The relationship between word and image in graphic novels, is not always seamless or complementary, and indeed, often demands critical engagement. Hirsch says that ‘words, images, and word-images’ placed together in graphic texts ‘enact the impossibility of seeing and the impossibility of not looking’, and that by asking ‘us to read back and forth’ they reveal ‘the materiality of words and the discursivity and narrativity of images’ (Hirsch 120).\n In Maus then, the relationship between image and text is used by Spiegelman to engage the reader with the plurality and constructedness of narrative accounts on the Holocaust. And in The Photographer and Palestine, words, photographs, and graphics, are juxtaposed in a parodic way, so as to encourage reader scrutiny in the narritavising of others’ stories. In short, this chapter intends to explore the ways in which ‘visual-verbal biocularity’ works to facilitate reader participation in narrative, and prevent the desensitization which has come to define representations of conflict (120).\nIn The Politics of Postmodernism (1989) Hutcheon explains how ‘text/image combinations work to point to the coded nature of all cultural messages. They do so by overtly being re-visions: they offer a second seeing, through double vision, wearing the spectacles of irony’ (123). Indeed, looking at the relationship between word and image, in reference to Roland Barthes, Hutcheon notes how ‘the addition of a linguistic message’ to a photograph or image, can either function as an ‘anchorage’ or a ‘relay’. Using the term anchorage, she implies a process whereby words or text can ‘fix’ an image, and ‘guide identification or interpretation’. But alternatively, she looks at how ‘the verbal in combination with the visual’ can ‘create a situation where there is double meaning and contradiction’, or what Barthes terms ‘relay’ (125).\n In comics, we sometimes see this latter relationship between word and image, and ‘above all’ the medium works to ‘de-naturalize the relation between the visual and the verbal and also any evaluative privileging of one over the other’ (125).\n Indeed, the contradiction between word and image, or the concept of ‘double vision’, is importantly used by Spiegelman in Maus to engage the reader with questions of representation, explicitly asking them to make judgements about the visual and verbal choices in the text for themselves. One obvious example of this is when Artie is questioning his father’s testimony that there was no orchestra playing as prisoners marched out of Auschwitz. The verbal account begins: ‘I just read about the camp orchestra that played as you marched out the gate’, to which Vladek responds: ‘An orchestra? … No. At the gate I heard only guards shouting’ (Spiegelman 214).\n While the reader would normally expect Spiegelman’s visual narrative to comply with the witness testimony; in the adjacent frames, we see a depiction of the orchestra, with marching prisoners, and another frame in which the prisoners cover the orchestra, except from the fingerboard of the cello, and the top of the conductor’s baton. Spiegelman wants to highlight that his father’s account of the Holocaust is not the only version of events, and that ‘it’s very well documented’, that there was an orchestra in Auschwitz. As such, he visualizes both versions of events, leaving the reader in a position in which they have to construct which narrative they wish to take forward (214). \n In an interview Spiegelman states that ‘instead of making comics into a narcotic, I’m trying to make comics that can wake you up, like caffeine comics that get you back in touch with things that are happening around you’ (Silverblatt 31). Through his presentation of this ‘double vision’, whereby the verbal narrative contradicts the visual medium, Spiegelman thus encourages the reader to make choices, and engage with the construction of the text.\n This participatory model of reading, is facilitated by visual-verbal hybridity, and indeed, prevents a reading response which is detached from the events being depicted Scott McCloud further comments on the interaction between different semiotic modes in comics, saying the overlap between the visual and verbal casts the reader into a space which exist in ‘the limbo of the gutter’, and where ‘a kind of magic’ happens that ‘only comics can create’ (McCloud 66, 92).\n  Indeed, it has often been observed that when reading a comic, the reader takes the words and images on the page and fuses them together to create their own particular narrative. Spiegelman, in an interview articulates this feature, saying: ‘I didn’t want people to get too interested in the drawing. I wanted them to be there, but the story operates somewhere else. It operates somewhere between the words and the idea that’s in the pictures and in the movement between the pictures’ (Brown 104).\n  As such, visual-verbal hybridity in comics, forces the reader into a position, in which they have to construct the series of historic and traumatic events in their own head, and are prevented from a superficial engagement. In order to achieve this effect in Maus, Spiegelman strips down the visual panels in his story to their bare essentials, presenting the reader with figures, whose expressions are conveyed in relatively few lines, and settings, in which a sense of place is constructed using minimal detail; like the small dotted wallpaper to convey the period. And verbally, Spiegelman says, he had to ‘distill’ his father’s accounts ‘to keep the phrases that are most telling’ (Brown 96).\n This economic approach to using words and image on the page, forces the reader to participate in the process of narrative reconstruction independently, or as McCloud says, it encourages the ‘phenomenon of observing the parts but perceiving the whole’ (McCloud 63).\n Andreas Huyssen explains this imaginative participation is what lead to the success of Peter Weiss’ post-war play about the Holocaust, The Investigation (1965). He says: ‘Auschwitz is not shown on stage; it is recreated through the memory of the accused, the witnesses and survivors who confront each other a second time in the courtroom trying to testify and to articulate what happened another time at another place’ (Huyssen, The Politics of Identification 131).\n In a similar way to the graphic novel, Weiss’ play refuses a representation of the tragedy of Auschwitz in a complete visually digestible way, instead it asks the viewer, or audience, to construct for themselves, through hearing the memories ‘of the accused’, the events, imaginatively on their own terms.\n Claude Lanzmann’s Shoa (1985), a much praised film dealing with the events of the Holocaust, must also be referenced here. The film is ‘made exclusively of testimonies: first-hand testimonies of participants in the historical experience of the Holocaust, interviewed and filmed by Lanzmann’, and ‘in contrast to its cinematic predecessors on the subject, it refuses systematically to use any historical, archival footage’ (Felman 205). As such, the audience is asked to engage in the process of the reconstruction of events imaginatively themselves, and encouraged to contemplate questions on the limits of visual representation, and what it means to engage with the suffering of others.\n While Maus offers a visual as well as a verbal account of the events of the Holocaust, and is therefore not completely comparable with Shoa or The Investigation, the overlap between image and text, forces the reader into a space in which they too are partly responsible for constructing the events. Indeed, Hutcheon says that Maus creates a ‘fictive heterocosm, a complete visual and verbal universe’, and as such, the reader is forced into a position where they are required to participate in this ‘universe’, and prevented from a desensitization to the suffering of others (Hutcheon, Postmodern Provocation 301).\n With further regard to word-image relationships, Hutcheon observes that when there is friction between the two, we sometimes see, what she terms ‘parodic intertextuality’ (Hutcheon, The Politics of Postmodernism 61). Or that, ‘the clashing of various possible’ narrative discourses (word and image) creates a ‘parodic’ situation, which challenges the reader’s ‘assumption of the seamlessness’ of narrative, and asks us to ‘question the process by which we represent’ (53). Indeed, in this sense, as she rightly points out, ‘postmodern parody is both deconstructively critical and constructively creative, paradoxically making us aware of both the limits and the power of representation’ (98).\n Its ‘constructively creative’ use can be seen especially well in Sacco’s Palestine, where he juxtaposes visual with verbal, to create parodic situations in his narrative, in which the reader is forced engage with the constructedness of his portrayal of others’ stories. In Ways of Seeing (1972) John Berger explains that ‘the meaning of an image is changed according to what one sees immediately beside it or what comes immediately after it’ (Berger 29). Throughout Sacco’s text, there are moments where he presents a panel, signifying one thing to the reader, but then sharply undermines or contradicts this through his verbal narration. As such, he changes the meaning of the image, as Berger argues, is a vulnerability of the visual medium, but he also creates a parodic situation, where the reader is forced to question his narrative authority.\n One particular example of this is when Sacco is in a hospital ward, and he sees a mother at the bedside of her injured son. The verbal narration says: ‘Ask her if I can take his picture’, to which the mother’s response is: ‘‘No’ in Arabic’ (Sacco 32). The visual frames presented, however, directly oppose the verbal, and laid across the page are two vivid graphic renditions of the injured son, teeth clenched together in pain. Considering how much Sacco uses photographic evidence for his non-photographic drawings – Katalin Orbán says ‘he relies on photos for the authentic recreation of scenes’ -  we can assume that he took the photograph of the injured boy, disobeying the mother (Orbán 131). The visual and verbal therefore clash, as Hutcheon says is typical of postmodern parody, and the effect is that the reader is forced to linger on the narrative account given by Sacco and subject it to criticism. \n As such, the reader participates in the process by which the narrative account is brought into being, and are far less likely to overlook, as Nixon explains is typical of representation of violence, the suffering of others. In the whole of Palestine, there is only one full page-spread not accompanied by verbal narration. Berger explains in relation to paintings unaccompanied by words, that they ‘are silent and still in a sense that information never is’ (Berger 31). Sacco’s inclusion of this one un-narrativised drawing, can be seen as a reminder of how powerfully his words influence the images in his story, and again, how as the reader, we should be constantly critical of where word and image meet to convey meaning.\n In The Photographer too, Orbán notes how ‘parodic-intertextuality’ encourages reader engagement with the narrative presented by Lefèvre (Hutcheon, The Politics of Postmodernism 61). She says: ‘the reading process is a very dynamic sequence of dizzying displacements’ and that ‘panelized contact strips significantly shift the logic of organization, status, and mode of viewing’ (Orbán 133). Indeed, the use of photographic, graphic and verbal narration, all interweaving with one another, prevent a seamless reading of events, but instead form an ordered chaos, laid out on the page, which the reader is required to make sense of.\n Thus, while Nancy Pedri looks at the relationship between word and image in The Photographer, saying ‘that which the photographs present visually restates and expands upon the verbal text’ and in this way ‘the two work together as equal partners in the creation of meaning’ (Pedri 17). It is more the case, that while words contextualize, and provide the images with definition (as explained in chapter one), this not an immediately intuitive process, but requires work and multimodal forms of reading.\n For example, having been invited to have a look at an injured girl who ‘hasn’t gotten up since the bombing’, Lefèvre provides the reader with a detailed verbal narrative account of the girl’s injuries, he says: ‘There’s no apparent wound. No Blood’ but ‘that little dot, there … that means she’ll never walk again’ (Lefèvre 134, 135). Due to the darkness of the room, however, Lefèvre doesn’t take any photographs, all the reader is left to observe, is graphic panels which depict the silhouettes of figures surrounding the little girl in the dark. And, in the later frames, when the girl has been taken out on a stretcher, the reader still, is only presented with photographs of a group of people, but never an image of the girl herself.\n As such, the reader is placed in a position, in which they have to thread together the disharmonious verbal narrative with the photographic, and non-photographic panels, to create for themselves, a rounded picture of the injuries which Lefèvre describes. The visual and verbal in this situation, do not match up, and the reader is left with a parodic situation, in which they have to tie the different mediums together in a logical way, thus personally contributing to the narratavising of the paralyzed girl’s story.\n Hutcheon says that the ‘conjunction of text and image raises new questions’ about representation in postmodern literature, and indeed, in The Photographer, we see how the two, in juxtaposition to one another, encourage and facilitate reader participation in the conflict experienced by others.In reference then, to what Sontag and Nixon say with regards to an increasing desensitization towards images and stories of conflict due to ‘rapidly eroding attention spans’ (Nixon 3)."

      text: "One of the major challenges of representing the suffering experienced by others is that normal chronological temporalities are often disrupted, and can become fragmentary and disorientating. In order to give expression to others’ pain then, writers are often forced to find innovative and creative ways to give figurative shape to the temporal confusion which is resultant when conflict is experienced or translated into words. The graphic novel, in the complex architecture of its pages, where a sense of time is created through the spatial layout of individual panels, allows for these complex temporalities to be represented. Indeed, Thierry Groensteen, a prominent comics theorist, has highlighted the unique way in which time operates in graphic novels, saying: ‘the position of a panel in the page corresponds to a particular moment in the unfolding of the story’ and that ‘each new panel hastens the story and, simultaneously, holds it back’ (Groensteen 35). As such, the writer of the graphic novel is able to manipulate the unfolding of time, and present it in the fragmentary and juxtaposing ways necessary for the representation of conflict. Scott McCloud, whose comics theory, this chapter will use along with Groensteen’s, has similarly articulated this as the way ‘panels fracture both time and space, offering a jagged staccato rhythm of unconnected moments’ (McCloud 67). In Maus Spiegelman uses this feature of the graphic novel to convey the way in which victims of trauma, like his father Vladek, experience the past and present as complicatedly entwined with one another. Lefèvre’s The Photographer is similarly able to unpack the difficult temporalities of photographs of conflict. Through the careful composition of both graphic and photographic panels on the page, he encourages the reader to ‘stop looking at photographs and instead start watching’ them (Azoulay 14). And finally, Sacco’s Palestine utilises the graphic novel’s spatio-topical system to convey the way in which Palestinians are victims of ‘slow violence’, a term Rob Nixon uses to refer to violence which has been rendered invisible due to the passing of time (Nixon 3). In short then, this chapter is an exploration into the ways in which the complex temporalities of violence and conflict, are productively represented in the graphic novel due to its unique temporal-spatial system. It is well established among trauma theorists, that in many cases, victims of trauma experience little distance between a moment of past suffering and the present. Ernst Van Alphen, for example, has noted how survivors of the Holocaust are susceptible to traumatic re-enactment, whereby ‘the original traumatic event has not yet been transformed into a mediated, distanced account’ but rather ‘re-imposes itself in its visual and sensory directness’ (Van Alphen 211). In its careful juxtaposition of past and present, Maus has been praised by numerous literary critics for the innovative and accurate way in which it portrays the experience of trauma victims as bound to their past. Andreas Huyssen has commented on how ‘historical and personal trauma’ are effectively ‘knotted together’ in the story, and Rosemary Hathaway has written about the way in which the ‘text reveals how powerfully the past influences the present’ (Huyssen, Of Mice and Mimesis 71) (Hathaway 250). Indeed, through his manipulation of the features of the graphic novel, Spiegelman is able to partly overcome the difficulty of representing the temporal complexity of trauma. In an interview, he states that comics are ‘about time being made manifest spatially’, and that this allows him to juxtapose past and present to depict ‘different times inhabiting the same space’ (Silverblatt 35) This device is used throughout the text, but is perhaps most effectual in a scene where Vladek is telling Artie about an incident in 1931, when the Germans ‘took four Jews away for dealing goods without coupons’, and made an example of them by leaving them to hang for ‘one full week’ on ‘Modrezejowska Street’ (Spiegelman 85). Spiegelman first emphasises the length of ‘one full week’ by providing one large frame containing a full picture of the hung Jews, followed by two smaller frames, which show only their dangling feet. The two smaller panels are separated by what Scott McCloud calls ‘moment-to-moment’ closure, whereby ‘very little’ action occurs between the frames (McCloud 74). The effect of this, is that the reader is forced to linger on the scene, and slow their pace of reading. In positioning the panels at the bottom right of the page, Spiegelman further uses what comic theorists term, a turn-page-reveal, which allows for a dramatic change of rhythm or scene on the next page. Indeed, Spiegelman presents three panels which depict a conversation between Artie and Vladek in present-time, where Vladek says: ‘Ach. When I think now of them, it still makes me cry […] look even from my dead eye tears are coming out’ (Spiegelman 86). Using the spatio-topical system of the graphic novel, Spiegelman thus juxtaposes past: the lingering frames depicting the four hung Jews, and present: Vladek becoming emotional at the memory. The ultimate effect, is that the reader is forced to consider the way in which for Vladek, this traumatic event is not ‘transformed into a mediated, distanced account’, but rather it exists in ‘visual and sensory directness’ (Van Alphen 211).\n In an essay on memory Aledia Assman has further commented on the way in which, for victims of trauma, memory is often ‘acquired by collective instruction, it is the site of continuous learning and acquisition of both general and specialized knowledge’ (Assman 36). She proposes that the individual does not always ‘preserve an original stimulus’ but rather creates their past through a ‘process of continuous re-inscription and reconstruction’ (39). In this sense traumatic timelines are not a string of linear events but a self-conception which depends on multiple different sources and fragmented temporalities. In Maus Spiegelman represents this model of traumatic memory, as he says, by ‘giving form to his father’s words and narrative’ through ‘panel size, panel rhythms, and visual structures on the page’ (Chute, The shadow of a past time 200). Indeed, the comics medium, in its composition using ‘interdependent images’, which when placed together create meaning, allow for multiple narrative voices, and sources to be individually presented on the page. Groensteen explains this in other words, saying: ‘the page is divided into randomly sectioned fragments’ which are ordered ‘according to an architectural perspective’ (Groensteen 34). As such, the process by which a traumatic memory, based on ‘re-inscription and ‘reconstruction’ is created, can be effectively presented in the graphic novel. When Artie is asking Vladek about the ‘bunkers’ that he had to build in order to avoid capture by the Germans, the memory is created by Spiegelman through a combination of both Vladek’s words, and a sketch which he draws. Vladek says: ‘I arranged for us a very good hiding spot in our cellar, where it was coal storage … show to me your pencil and I can explain’ (Spiegelman 112). The memory of the ‘bunker’ is therefore represented by Spiegelman as heterogeneous: one half of the double-page shows a visual rendering of the bunker, and above, Vladek’s verbal narrative account of how he built it. On the following page, Spiegelman combines the two sources and incorporates it into his more complete narrative account of Vladek’s experience while in the Srodula Ghetto. The comics medium therefore allows Spiegelman to show the way in which memory is an architectural formation, and subject to constant ‘reconstruction’. Indeed, towards the end of Maus while Artie is asking Vladek about his release from Auschwitz, Vladek states: ‘all such things of the war, I tried to put out from my mind once and for all … until you rebuild me all this from your questions’ (258). Time in Maus is therefore represented a series of fragmented moments, which more accurately depict the way in which memory and trauma are experienced. It is only through the form of the graphic novel, with its sense of temporality being created through juxtaposing panels, that Spiegelman is so effectively able to show this.\n In a similar way to how Maus uses the graphic novel to represent the difficult temporalities of trauma and memory, in The Photographer Lefèvre attempts to overcome the atemporality of war photography to illicit a more emotional response from the viewer. Ariella Azoulay has argued that ‘photography is much more than what is printed on the photographic paper. The photograph bears the seal of the photographic event, and reconstructing this event requires more than just identifying what is shown in the photograph’ (Azoulay 14). Susan Sontag, however, has pointed out that in most cases a photograph ‘flares up, is shared by many people, and fades from view’, and our mode of looking, whether or not we mean it to be, becomes an act of voyeurism (Sontag). How then, as Azoulay notes, do we start ‘watching’ photographs, and reinscribe them with a sense of temporality that encourages the reader to engage with the conflict that they depict.\n In The Photographer Lefèvre places his photographs of Afghanistan in amongst non-photographic panels, thereby narrativising them and reconstructing their complex temporality on the page. In a village called Püstük, which ‘has been spared by … bombs’, Lefèvre photographs many injured civilians, and on one particular page of the graphic novel, he enlarges a picture of a badly injured boy of ‘maybe two or three’ (Lefèvre 129, 132). Looking at the photograph, the reader can extrapolate that the boy is injured, but not how badly, and the identity of the girl beside him (perhaps his mother) cannot be known. It is a powerful photograph, but it is almost impossible to establish its timeline. Teju Cole suggests this is common of photographs of war, where there are often questions which are ‘hard to answer only by looking at the photograph’ (Cole). Through the comics medium, however, Lefèvre provides the photograph with a sense of movement. In the preceding panels, he shows the sounds the boy is making: ‘a little wail of aoh’, and a few pages later, we learn from Juliette, of the child’s death. She exclaims: ‘He must have had internal bleeding’ and ‘the mother said to me, ‘film it, Jamilia. People have to know’’ (Lefèvre 136). Scott McCloud, has argued that comics force the ‘human imagination’ to take ‘two separate images and transform them into a single idea’ (McCloud 67). What Lefèvre is achieving then, by accompanying his photographs with non-photographic panels, is a sense of narrative, or ‘single idea’, which allows the reader, or viewer, to overcome the atemporality of photographs, and engage with the suffering experienced by the people in them. Indeed, Susan Sontag has noted that ‘to photograph is to frame, and to frame is to exclude’ and that ‘narrative seems likely to be more effective than an image’ (Sontag). The graphic novel can therefore be seen partly as a solution on how to take a photograph, and inscribe it with a sense of time, as Azoulay says, to establish that it represents more than just a piece of paper, but the real-life suffering of other individuals.\n The comics medium further allows for time to expand or contract depending on the layout of panels on the page. Or more specifically, as Groensteen points out, ‘a panel is not presented as isolated. It participates in a series (most often sequential, or narrative) offered to the reader’, and it is up to the writer to determine the rhythm of reading, depending on the placement of these panels (Groensteen 47, 61). This feature of the graphic novel is utilized by Lefèvre to engage the reader in specific moments of conflict depicted in his photographs. He prevents them being viewed as static, and reinscribes them with a particular sense of time. Indeed, Nancy Pedri has commented on this in her analysis of the The Photographer, saying ‘the temporal implications of the photographic sequence are restated and the narrative details expanded upon’ (Pedri). This is especially apparent, in a sequence of images presented of a man with a minor wound, which the narrative introduces: ‘that’s a scene I’ve seen a hundred times in the movies: the hero takes a swig of whisky bites down on a piece of wood, and aaarh! They extract the bullet with pliers in one sharp tug … the truth is that the whole things is excruciatingly painful’ (Lefèvre 128). In order to convey the pain the individual feels, Lefèvre presents multiple frames, in quick succession, in the form of a photographic test-sheet. Normally, in comics, as Groensteen explains, ‘the eye’s movement on the surface of the page are relatively erratic and do not respect any precise protocol’, here however, the uniformed presentation of individual panels, forces the reader to engage with the particular incident, and experience a slowing down of time (Groensteen 47). The ‘breathing’ of the reader becomes ‘affected’, and as such, it is possible to reflect more carefully on the conflict the pictures represent (61). Throughout The Photographer a red wax marker is used to indicate the individual exposures from amongst Lefèvre’s test-sheets, which he would have chosen to develop. This is a constant reminder for the reader, that without the contextualization of these photographs using the graphic novel’s distinctive paneling system as a means of creating a sense of time and narrative; these photographs, and the people in them, would be assigned to a temporal void. Indeed, Susan Sontag has pointed out how photography supposedly act as an authentic claim or evidence to the fact that something has happened, but she also notes: ‘evidence of what?’. This, we cannot know, unless, as The Photographer shows, the reader is provided with a narrativised and temporal accompaniment to a photograph.  As such, the comics medium, can be seen to endow photographs with movement, through the layout of the panels spatially across a page, and encourage a genuine engagement with the suffering experienced by others.\n Overcoming the difficult temporalities of others’ suffering is also an issue in Sacco’s graphic novel: Palestine. Indeed, In Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor (2011) Rob Nixon uses the term ‘slow violence’ to refer to ‘a violence of delayed destruction that is dispersed across time and space’ (Nixon 2). He explains that not all violence is ‘immediate in time, explosive and spectacular’ but sometimes it occurs gradually and out of sight where ‘casualties are postponed, often for generations’. How then, he asks, is this violence represented, or in other words, how are ‘arresting stories, images, and symbols adequate to the pervasive but elusive violence of delayed effects’ constructed (3). This is a challenge Sacco faces in representing the suffering experienced by Palestinians. Indeed, in the introduction to the book, Edward Said notes that Sacco is confronted with the task of representing a suffering which has its origins firmly grounded in a much overlooked and largely invisible history. He refers to the famous statement made by Golda Meir in the Sunday Times in 1969, in which she said: there was ‘no such thing as Palestinians … it was not as though there was a Palestinians people in Palestine considering itself as a Palestinians people’ (Parmenter 20). Thus, Sacco’s Palestine is an attempt to accomplish, through the manipulation of the graphic novel’s spatio-topical system, a reimaging of the violence which currently effects Palestinians, but which also has its origins in the past. In the first chapter, for example, Sacco spatially apposes two pages: one on which a Palestinian refugee in Jabilia tells the story of how his family were forced to flee in 1948, saying ‘The Jews came and occupied the village and arrested everyone left behind …  It was a black day when I left my land’ (Sacco 15). The other page depicts a Jewish American, who says: ‘Well I’m actually American but this feels like home to me’, with Sacco’s interjection about the American: ‘he’s got full Israeli citizenship if he wants, that’s the Law of Return, any Jew from anywhere can ‘return here’’ (14). On two pages then, which the reader can view all at one, Sacco shows the tragedy of the Palestinian situation. While the American-Jew, who has never been to the region before, can claim citizenship, the Palestinian, disposed in 1948, still remains a refugee. Hilary Chute expresses of Sacco’s work that it ‘strives to materialize visually an archive of oral testimony … reconstructing the bodies of others, bodies that have been ignored by official discourse’ (Chute, Comics Form and Narrating Lives 112). Indeed, on this double page, Sacco is able to contrast two different temporal situations (the American’s and the Palestinian’s), to highlight the fact that Palestinians still suffer the consequences of dispossession, even if unseen, while Israel moves on. In short then, he gives form to the invisible suffering of Palestinians, which Nixon explains is characteristic of ‘slow violence’, through his manipulation and juxtaposition of panels in his graphic novel.\n Talking about comics, Federico Fellini says that ‘more than film’, they benefit ‘from the collaboration of the readers: one tells them a story that they tell to themselves; with their particular rhythm and imagination, in moving forward and backward’ (Groensteen 11). Indeed, using the graphic novel, the writer can ask the reader to imagine time not as linear and chronological, but instead, as something constructed on the page. Through the placement of individual panels spatially, time can be fragmented, and manipulated so as to accommodate more complicated temporal situations. In representing the violence and pain experienced by others, normal temporalities, as this chapter has explained, are disorientated. The graphic-novel’s temporal spatial system, which allows for more flexibility, is thus used in Maus, The Photographer and Palestine in order to better engage their readers with the duration of conflict represented in their respective texts."

    text: "In representing the conflict and pain experienced by others there is a danger of becoming a voyeur, a tourist of suffering, or at least a propagator of false information. A large question therefore resides in the moral implications of representing the misfortune of others, especially if it is done from a position of privilege. Rob Nixon has written extensively on the role of the ‘writer activist’, which he describes as category of writers that embrace the ‘challenges of translating across chasms of class, race, gender, and nation’, and who ‘are enraged by injustices they wish to see redressed’. He asks how these writers engage with global violations while also challenging their own privilege, or in his words, the ‘privilege of the visible’. Indeed, in representing the pain experienced by others, especially through literary means, writers must acknowledge their fortunate place, at a distance from the suffering they wish to expose. This article therefore intends to explore the ways in which the graphic novel attempts to overcome the moral problematics of representing others’ pain. Linda Hutcheon explains that a defining characteristic of postmodern writing is that it is ‘premised on a challenge to the realist notion of representation that presumes transparency of the medium’, and a self-reflexivity that acknowledges the shortcomings of narrative authority. Spiegelman, Lefèvre and Sacco all employ postmodern metafictional components in their work as a way of drawing attention to the constructedness of their respective narrative accounts. In Maus metafiction is used by Spiegelman to abandon any claims that his graphic novel is an exhaustive account on the events of the Holocaust. Lefèvre’s The Photographer similarly employs postmodern devices as a means of drawing attention to his role as a naïve, Western photographer in Afghanistan. And in Palestine, Sacco frequently makes reference to his own impartiality, and the incompleteness of his narrative reportage while in the region. \n The historian Dominik LaCapra observes that in representing the Holocaust, outside the role of the witness, there is a danger in venturing towards morally insensitive stylistic excess. Or more specifically, that in the reconstruction of traumatic events, often in the form of fiction or art, there is a tendency to do so in ‘terms of an insufficiently differentiated, rashly generalized, hyperbolic aesthetic of the sublime’. Schindler’s List (1994) directed by Steven Spielberg, or even the more recent work by László Nemes, Son of Saul (2015) illustrate this aesthetic excess, or what LaCapra terms the ‘dubious consequence’ of representation. Indeed, the aestheticized treatment of the Holocaust in both of these films, some critics argue, takes away from the real trauma of the event. Comparing the two, Stefan Grissemann has asserted that while Nemes’ ‘art-house experiment refuses sentimentality and character identification’ making it the ‘antitheses of Spielberg’s Holocaust’, Son of Saul ‘remains at a distance from the reality it reaches for’. Literary critic, Andreas Huyssen, has similarly observed the way in which the culture industry, in the aftermath of the Holocaust, tended towards ‘Brechtian parable plays’, which abstracted the traumatic events with the intention of creating a ‘distance’ from which spectators could develop a rational understanding of the Holocaust. However, the ‘avant-gardist’ approach towards representation, Huyssen argues was ‘ironic’, for while it ‘enabled playwrights to attack the Third Reich’ it also ‘prevented audience identification with the historic specificity of Jewish suffering’. Like the Brechtian plays of the 1950s, Art Spiegelman’s Maus uses cats and mice allegorically to tell the story of Jewish persecution at the hands of Nazi Germany. The novel, with its visual components and heavily stylized pages, is therefore positioned dangerously close to the cinematic experimentation of Spielberg and Nemes. However, the metafictional components included in Maus are utilized by Spiegelman to abandon any claims of totality of representation, and through showing the processes he worked through in publishing Maus, the novel party resolves the issue of representing others’ pain. \n Hilary Chute argues that ‘the most metafictional section’ of Maus is the chapter ‘Time Flies’ which allows Spiegelman to reflect on the ‘viability’ of his ‘present project’. Indeed, the first page opens with Art wearing a mouse mask, looking towards the reader saying: ‘In September 1986, after 8 years of work, the first part of Maus was published. It was a critical and commercial success’. In wearing the mask, Spiegelman is confessing to his concerns about profiteering from the suffering of so many deaths (it suggests he is only pretending to be Jewish), and in the next frame we see him at his drawing board, looking conscious-stricken, with a pile of bodies underneath his chair. The inclusion of himself in the narrative, discussing the book we are reading, allows Spiegelman to tackle directly, any claims that Maus attempts at a transparency of events, or a complete authentic account of the Holocaust. Indeed, as the chapter progresses, Art is asked by multiple journalists about the success of his book: ‘tell our viewers what message you want them to get’, to which his responses become increasingly desperate and confused: ‘I have no idea’, ‘Who am I to say’ and ‘Huh?’. In the course of these questions, we see the body of Art transform from a full sized adult into that of a child, who eventually screams ‘Wah … I want my mommy’ (202). In depicting himself as an infant, Spiegelman thus attempts to highlight his own distance and alienation from the Holocaust, and his acknowledgement that he cannot comprehend the entirety or complexity of the events. Later in the chapter, the infantile Spiegelman talks to his psychologist, saying: ‘My father worked in a tin shop near the camp. I have no idea what kind of tools and stuff to draw. There’s no documentation’ (206). Hathaway describes one of the major characteristics of postmodern ethnography as its tendency to ‘start from a place of defeat: how can a single account convey the dynamic, multivalent, contested nature of any cultural group or phenomenon’. In pointing out, as he does by admitting to his psychologist, that he doesn’t know what a ‘tin shop near the camp’ would have looked like, as well as consistently outlining his own narrative shortcomings, Spiegelman drops all claims of a complete and accurate representation of his father’s experience of the Holocaust. As such, metafiction is effectively used in the novel, to overcome the problematics of making an aesthetic experience, as La Capra warns, of others’ pain. \n Huyssen’s essay looking at Maus in relation to what Adorno famously claimed about representations of the Holocaust - ‘To write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric’ - further argues that Spiegelman, by drawing on comics ‘as a mass cultural genre’ and saturating his text ‘with modernist techniques of self-reflexivity’ avoids morally insensitive representation. One such technique Spiegelman uses for achieving this self-reflexivity, according to Huyssen, is the inclusion of ‘irony, shock’ and ‘black humor’ in the novel (81). Indeed, an example of this is in the section of the Maus titled ‘Prisoner of the Hell Planet: A Case History’, in which Spiegelman presents himself in highly stylized, almost wood-cut like prints, dressed in the clothing of an Auschwitz prisoner. By representing himself in such clothing, Spiegelman is ironically embracing what so many Holocaust representations attempt to avoid: over-stepping the mark, and giving too subjective a version of events which then compromise the authenticity of the historic account given. Indeed, despite having asserted in interviews that ‘I’ve never been through anything like that’, in reference to the Holocaust; by referring to himself as a victim, Spiegelman is highlighting the way in which he brings his own personal history into his representation, and his feelings of resentment at having been the child of Holocaust survivors. Huyssen has said that: ‘the memories of Auschwitz do not only claim Anja; they also envelop the son born years after the war’. On the next page of the integrated comic - Prisoner of the Hell Planet -  Spiegelman announces behind prison bars: ‘Well, mom. If you’re listening … Congratulations! You’ve committed the perfect crime … you put me here … shorted all my circuits… cut my nerve endings … and crossed my wires! ... your murdered me me. Mommy’. The referral to his mother as the ‘murderer’ is deeply ironic, considering her status as a survivor of the concentration camps, and consequential victim of suicide. Yet the inclusion of these ironic portrayals and subversions of who is victim and perpetrator, dramatically emphasises the non-objectivity of the historic account given by Spiegelman. No representation which attempts at complete transparency would venture to make the insinuation that victims of the Holocaust are ‘murderers’. Hathaway has stated that Spiegelman’s negative portrayal of himself, as we have seen in this section, is an ‘acknowledgement of the difficulty – if not the impossibility – of letting fieldwork subjects speak for themselves’. Indeed, the presentation of his father and mother’s experience of the Holocaust has the traces of his words all over it.  As such, Maus offers a representation of the Holocaust which avoids largely the moral pitfalls of depicting the suffering ‘of others, through the inclusion, and criticism of himself in the text. Or as Linda Hutcheon has noted on postmodern representational practices, Maus can be seen to ‘refuse to stay neatly within accepted conventions and traditions’, instead employing metafictional techniques which refuse ‘control and mastery’. \n The Photographer and Palestine similarly struggle with the moral challenge of representing conflict from the perspective of an outsider, or more specifically, the perspective of tourist and travel writer. This has been picked up by Monica Chiū in her essay on travel narratives and comics, in which she asserts that ‘while travel writers might be aware of […] global inequalities, they are often unaware of how the act of writing about travel itself engenders contemporary power formations that are unequal’. Indeed, in his representation of Afghani turmoil as someone from the West, Lefèvre unavoidably situates himself in the contentious and extensive debate on neo-colonial and imperializing gazes, as does Sacco in his presentation of Palestine. Linda Nochlin in The Politics of Vision (1991) outlines the West’s historic tendency to invent, through supposedly ‘objective reportage’ an image of the ‘Orient’. Through a deliberate process of selection and exclusion, she explains artists and writers have artificially constructed, in their own terms, a vision of the East as ‘Other’. To such an extent that ‘The white man, the Westerner’ is always present in depictions of the East, and that it is through his gaze that the image of the Oriental world is brought into being. In depicting the suffering of Afghani individuals, partly using the photographic medium, which Sontag explains is built to ‘frame’ and ‘exclude’, The Photographer risks falling into a long tradition, whereby artists and writers have fabricated an image of the East, which disregards the intentions of those being represented. Indeed, Sontag emphasises how some of the most ‘canonical images of early war photography turn out to have been staged, or to have had their subjects tampered with’. Similarly, in Sacco’s narrative account of Palestinian lives, he is in the privileged position of giving shape and form to others’ experiences of suffering, and in control of how their stories are translated into words. In both The Photographer and Palestine, however, Lefèvre and Sacco are careful to make use postmodern metafiction, like Spiegelman does in Maus, to overcome the potentially disastrous consequences of representing the suffering experienced by others without reinforcing and contributing to a neo-colonial rhetoric. \n Commenting on Orientalism in Western Literature, Said has pointed out the tendency to present ‘the cultural inferiority of the Islamic Orient’ and attempts to ‘perpetuate European dominance’. The Photographer and Palestine expresses an awareness of their relationship to this Western literary tradition, and take careful steps to avoid narrative mastery by detailing the short-comings of their own narrators: Lefèvre and Sacco. In an introduction to The Photographer, Alexis Siegel states ‘We discover Afghanistan through the eyes and camera of [a] photojournalist […] who is admittedly naïve about the geopolitical complexities that he is stumbling into’. Indeed, deciding to abandon the MSF trip, Lefèvre makes the journey from Afghanistan back to Pakistan, expecting the organization to provide guides to help him. On realizing that the guides he has been sent, aren’t the experienced ‘Muji’ which he has been accustomed to throughout his trip, he complains to Odile, a member of the MSF team: ‘Bassir gave me a bunch of useless creeps’, to which she responds, ‘you poor thing! … I can’t really blame him, though. He can’t afford to assign four muji to a guy who’s going back alone. He’s keeping his muji for the winter or sending them with major caravans’. The metafictional presentation of himself in The Photographer demanding special treatment, undermines Lefèvre’s narrative authority, and the reader is encouraged to consider the story and its representations as tainted by Western bias. Lefèvre’s decision to walk to Pakistan also results in a near death experience, where unable to do the most fundamental tasks, like strap luggage to his horse, he becomes stranded in the mountains. His subsequent rescue by a ‘caravan’ headed by a ‘wolf faced’ Afghani, subverts the hierarchy which presumes the Westerner has the most knowledge. Indeed, as Chiū has points out, The Photographer juxtaposes ‘the white protagonists against their non-white counterparts to ask who has power and visibility in the narrative, in which situations, and why?’. In Palestine too, Sacco is eager to point towards his own privilege in representing others’ suffering. In the chapter ‘Refugee Land’, in which he visits a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, he deliberately emphasises his position as tourist: ‘So I saw Gaza, sort of… I did the UNRWA tour, in and out in two hours’, and frequently paints himself in an unsympathetic light: ‘Tomorrow I’m going to another camp, Jabilia … I’d rather not … I’d rather sit around a heater with people like Larry and read Edward Said’.  Sacco’s text is brimming these examples, in which he comes across as insensitive, or apathetic to the hardship which he reports on. The effect is that the reader learns to distrust his narrative, or is at least encouraged to question the authority of his voice, and the claims he makes. \n In The Photographer Lefèvre frequently represents the process by which he has taken a photograph, and in Palestine too, there are constant referrals throughout the novel, to the way in which Sacco gathers sources and material for his writing. As such, both text encourage a critical engagement with their methods of representation, which contrasts the transparency characteristic of neo-colonial depictions of the East. Sontag explains that photographs have the ‘advantage of uniting two contradictory features’ in that their ‘credentials of objectivity’ are in built, but that they almost always have a ‘point of view’. Lefèvre deliberately highlights that his photographs are not objective reportage, but rather the product of his own decisions and the processes he works through. Waking up from a night’s sleep in the ‘town square of Kantiwa’, Lefèvre sees a photo opportunity, he says: ‘I know I should take a picture, but feel so empty… I fumble in my bag and weakly pull out the first camera I feel… barely frame the picture … there so be it’. On the following page we are presented with one of the most striking photographs in the novel, a picture of two tall Muji standing with a small child beneath them. The narrative account of producing the photograph, which in this incident is inattentively done, allows the reader to question the impartiality behind its creation. It bears the trace of Lefèvre’s input rather than appearing objective, which Nochlin criticizes in previous colonial depictions of the East: the absense of the artist which would ‘give credibility to the ‘realness’ of the work as a whole, to authenticate the total visual field as simple, artless reflection – in this case, of a supposed Oriental reality’. In a later incident, Lefèvre also refers to an effort made by the ‘Wakil’ to get all his men to line up in front of their barracks for a photograph. He then states: ‘all that commotion for a picture they’ll never see’. His reference to the incident, and the commentary on the picture’s creation allows Lèfevre to address one of the central problems of photographing others: the privilege of the photographer over the photographic subject, both in how the picture is created, but also the after-life of the photograph. In Palestine, this is also something Sacco draws attention towards. He highlights the subjectivity, and sometimes lack of input from his subjects, in his narrative account, by depicting the way he gathers material for his novel. In a hospital ward, we see him, camera in hand, moving around hospital beds saying: ‘I’m warming up to my photo op … I’m prowling around looking for angels’. He presents himself as very much a part of the photographic process, intruding in on others’ injuries, rather than a being a neutral by stander. We see that the way he gathers sources is not impartial, but something which very much involves his subjective input. As such, the metafictional inclusion of themselves in the narrative, as well as outlining the process by which the narrative is constructed – both distinctly postmodern techniques – allows Lefèvre and Sacco to forgo the ‘totalizing impulse’ of western literature, and takes strides towards a representation which is, morally, less questionable. \n In short then, while representing the conflict experienced by others is normally complicated by the privileged position held by the person providing the narrative account. Like artistic accounts of the Holocaust, or depictions of the East, from the perspective of an outsider, which are susceptible to acquiring a colonial gaze. In the graphic novels: Maus, The Photographer and Palestine, metafiction, and the inclusion of the author in the narration, allows for a self-reflexivity which prevents any claim at a totalizing narrative, or authorial voice. In all the texts, the reader is encouraged to mistrust the accuracy of the representation at all points of the narrative, and as such, there is an engagement with the conflict experienced by others that is not tainted by voyeurism, or moral insensitivity."

    title: "Urban Development in Literature",
    src: "il_two.png",
    text: "How urban spaces are experienced can be seen as determined by the competing ideological standpoints of architects, developers and social activists. Despots like Robert Moses and Le Corbusier represent a ‘top-down’ approach towards city planning, where the ‘surgical removal’ of diverse neighborhoods and their replacement with ‘modern slabs’, are seen as the most efficient way of ensuring progress and improvement in a city. In opposition to this ‘homogenizing clarity’, stands the model of ‘bottom-up’ regeneration, advocated by Jane Jacobs, who insists the city is a complex ‘ecosystem’ in which urban spaces are gradually improved through community investment and non-centralized planning (Tyrnauer). The experience of urban life, this essay intends to argue, is normally defined by the equilibrium created by these competing ideological positions; but recently, the development of new technology and the increasing influence of digitization, has favored the ‘top-down’ model of city planning. The consequence is that the experience of urban life in the twenty-first-century, is defined by the structure and order imposed by omnipotent architects and developers. The first section of this article will use Zadie Smith’s White Teeth to give shape, through drawing on literary examples, the ambitions and characteristics of the diametrically opposed models of urban planning represented by Jacobs and Moses. It will then show how the latter model of regeneration takes form in Benjamin Markovits’ You Don’t Have to Live Like This, and the way technology is utilized by Robert James to enforce his ‘top-down’ gentrification of Detroit. And finally, it will use Jennifer Egan’s A Visit from the Goon Squad, to highlight the totalistic way in which urban life is experienced when technology facilitates the Moses and Le Corbusier approach towards urban planning. In short, this essay is an exploration of the ways twenty-first-century fiction depicts the dangers of urban life which has been informed by the fatal combination of technology and despotic leadership.\n It is first necessary to give shape to the type of urban development practiced by Le Corbusier and Robert Moses; and in Smith’s White Teeth, the Chalfens, a particularly self-satisfied middle class family, can be seen as literary parallels to these omnipotent architectural figures. Owen Hatherely explains that these despots were characterized by their attempts to ‘play God’ and ‘superimpose’ their own logic onto the fabric of the city (Hatherely 13). In a similar way, when we are introduced to the Chalfens, Joyce describes her husband Marcus, as someone who ‘didn’t just make money’, but who ‘created beings’ and ‘went to the edges of God’s imagination [making] mice Yahweh could not conceive of’ (Smith 311). Like Moses and Le Corbusier, Marcus sees it as his personal role to ‘play God’, and artificially interfere with naturally occurring life forms, to make abnormal structures like ‘mice with webbed feet’ or ‘mice with rabbit genes’ (311). The parallel continues: Moses famously stated, ‘you can’t make an omelette without breaking some eggs’ (Tyrnauer). The implication clearly being that while he recognised his housing projects adversely affected settled communities, he considered their uprooting secondary to the goal of urban development and progress. In White Teeth, the activists who oppose Marcus’ research, the ‘horrible people Joyce had to shoo from the door with a curtain pole’, are like the uprooted communities, in that they supposedly fail to grasp ‘the simple fact’ that Marcus’ experiments are carried out with ‘humanity in mind’ (Smith 312). The Chalfens are emblematic of the domineering architectural mindset, and like Moses and Le Corbusier, they dismiss legitimate criticism against their artificial interference with organic orders, as the unavoidable protestations of luddites. Another characteristic of this model of urban planning, is the desire to form ‘monocultures’, by destroying ‘human-networks’ and replacing them ‘with emptiness and formality’ (Hatherely 13). Joyce, who can’t avoid the sterility of her middle class privilege, admits that ‘sometimes there seemed nothing to improve, nothing to cultivate’ in her family life (314). Hence, her salivation when the opportunity arises to make a project out of Millat and Irie; to turn them into manikins, similar to how Moses would homogenize a site of urban diversity (314). Indeed, she views the two children the way she does ‘her Garter Knight delphinium’, as objects to be cultivated, and their difference nursed into clinical uniformity (314). The Chalfen family in White Teeth are therefore remarkably analogous to Le Corbusier and Moses, and are useful literary reference points in articulating a mentality towards city planning which privileges control and order over diversity and organic growth.\n In opposition to the orthodox, top-down attitude towards urban development, stands Jacobs’ notion of cities as ‘productive ecosystems’, in which she thinks ‘thousands of different actors’ should ‘spontaneously come together in an uncoordinated way’ (Tyrnauer). In her book, The Death and Life of Great American Cities, Jacobs observed that ‘under the seeming disorder of the old city, wherever the old city is working successfully, is a marvelous order for maintaining the safety of the streets and the freedom of the city’ (Jacobs 50). Smith’s White Teeth also reflects this more dynamic model for urban development, where communities, through a shared engagement with urban spaces, organically improve and bring coherence to the city. While in Whitechapel, the Iqbal family, who consist of first and second generation migrants, are exposed to Enoch Powell’s oppressive speech encouraging urgent action against immigrants, to establish order in communities (Smith 62). In moving to Willesden, however, we see Alsana resolve racial barriers through engagement with public facilities and urban spaces. Initially prejudiced herself, denouncing other ‘minorit[ies] she disliked’, Alsana soon forms an important relationship with Clara, a Jamaican, where the two go for ‘picnics and outings’, and to the cinema to watch ‘French movies where Alsana’ would cover ‘her eyes at the suggestion of nudity’ (65, 74).  In making use of public spaces, like parks and cinemas, Alsana and Clara reflect Jacobs’ model of urban development, where, as Hatherley points out, shared spaces become ‘social centres’, and neighborhoods can be prosperous without the intervention of developers like Moses and Le Corbusier (Hatherley 13). Another example of this is ‘O Connell’s’, which Smith describes as ‘the kind of place family men come to for a different kind of family’, and which Archie and Samad make their ‘home from home’ (Smith 184). Smith further writes that ‘there are reasons why O’Connell’s is an Irish pool house run by Arabs with no pool tables […] But you need to hang around for that kind of information’ (184). Hatherley explains of Jacobs, that one of her main arguments was that ‘cities can and should be understood on foot, by ordinary people’, as this was the only way of understanding the value and potential of ‘bottom-up’ regeneration (Hatherley 13). In reference to White Teeth, through its emphasis that ‘you need to hang around’ to understand O’Connell’s, Smith’s book highlights that cities are complex and multifaceted, and cannot be understood from the aerial perspective, which most planners and architects design from. In short then, the models of urban development represented by Moses and Jacobs both work alongside each other in White Teeth, and the book therefore illustrates how cities are normally experienced by the interaction between these two competing visions.\n In Benjamin Markovits’ You Don’t Have to Live Like This, however, we see the Jacobs model of urban development become increasingly dominated by the invasive approach practiced by Moses and Le Corbusier. As Johnny Miller observes, Markovits’ novel, which is based on real-life attempts to revitalize Detroit, highlights that many of its neighborhoods were ‘middle-class’ and only ‘seen through the eyes of others as slums or ghettos because of the colour of the people who lived there’ (Miller). Indeed, in his presentation of the relationship between Nolan, an ‘original Detroiter’, and Marnie, one of Robert James’ friends from Yale; the regeneration project is revealed by Markovits to be forceful and oblivious to the real needs of the people in the city (Markovits 39). When Marnie first moves to the house Robert James has picked out for him on Johanna Street, his cohort of electricians acquired through nepotism, need to ‘shut off the electricity’ in the neighborhood ‘for a couple of hours’ (67). Nolan responds to their ‘courtesy call’ saying, ‘If you need to shut down the street, you may do so at my convenience. Now is not a convenient time for me’, but nevertheless, the electricians proceed to ‘shut down the street’ (68). James Baldwin famously observed that urban development projects similar to Moses and James’, were a form of ‘Negro Removal’, and the conflict between Marnie and Nolan, is indicative of this remark, in that it sees Nolan, a black inhabitant of Detroit, placed secondary to the needs of the white settlers (Baldwin 42). Nat Segnit elaborates on this, arguing that the urban development that occurs in Markovits’ novel, is a form of ‘ethnic colonialism’, and that the neighborhoods that ‘make up New Jamestown are predominantly white and middle-class, in a city that is neither’ (Segnit 19). Indeed, Nolan acknowledges this aspect of James’ project, and despite the consensus amongst the settlers gentrifying Detroit, that ‘old Detroit blacks should be grateful’ for the ‘pushing up of property prices and giving some of them domestic employment’, he explains the reality to Marnie, saying: ‘How much money have you people brought into the city that you didn’t spend on yourselves’ (Markovits 151, 317). The urban planning practiced by Moses and Le Corbusier deliberately ‘flattened communities’, to ensure interaction with urban spaces that subscribed to their architectural ideals (Hatherely 13). In Markovits’ novel, Robert James similarly encourages the demolition of existing communities, to make room for his neo-colonial ‘development model’ (Markovits 29).\n  While the experience of urban life is normally kept in balance by the competition between Jacobs and Moses’ models for urban development; Robert James’ ‘early settlers’ program in Detroit, highlights the way online platforms and virtual communities, have increasingly allowed for the dominance of Moses’ ‘top-down’ form of planning (53). Theresa Enright explains how the ‘proliferation of technology-led startup entrepreneurship in cities and metropolitan regions’ has ‘ended up reinforcing existing socio-spatial inequalities’ (Enright 47). In You Don’t Have to Live Like This, James’ ‘Groupon model for gentrification’ confirms Enright’s argument, in that his online site, ‘Starting-from-scratch-in-America’, encourages select groups to come together and ‘bid’ for ‘houses and plots of land like an airline check-in chart’ (Markovits 17, 57). Not only does this site allow for decisions to be made about the development of Detroit without the consultation of communities who already exist there, but it also discourages the organic and participatory development of neighborhoods, as advocated for by Jacobs. Keith Hampton further explains that ‘mobile phones make those who are already familiar always available; they connect people with existing members of their social network’, but to the point where ‘intense participation in closed networks [is] at the expense of broader social participation’ (Hampton 705). The group selected by Robert James from his Yale days to help him develop Detroit, including Marnie, Beatrice and Walter, are indicative of the ‘closed network’ outlined by Hampton; and Marnie’s observation that, ‘we sat around all day looking at Facebook, deciding who would get to join our village’, clearly indicates the role of technology in allowing for this non-inclusive and deliberately in opposition to Jacobs ‘bottom-up’ regeneration (Markovits 57). Mobilizations of people, like James’ are successful when ‘barriers to participation’ are removed, and in Markovits’ novel, technology is the means by which James removes barriers for his urban-renewal project (Klandermans 519). Ultimately then, You Don’t Have to Live Like This reveals the way urban space, through a growing influence of technology, is becoming increasingly dominated by a model of urban development, that like Moses’, is forceful and intentionally exclusive.\n In the last chapter of A Visit from the Goon Squad Jennifer Egan depicts a future society where the combination of omnipotent planning and technology, as seen in Markovits’ novel, has reached new heights, and encouraged urban life to be experienced in a controlled and pre-determined way. Robert Moses intended for people to interact with the city in a way which, as Hatherley points out, reflected his own vision of how ‘cities should be’ (Hatherley 13). In her presentation of the Scotty Hausmann concert, Egan hints at the way surveillance technology might allow figures, like Moses, to achieve this objective. Katherine Johnston argues that in Egan’s novel, people are aware that their ‘private actions and interactions are monitored’ but in a way that ‘remains vague and unthreatening’ (Johnston 164). Indeed, when Alex is looking for his wife in the audience of the concert, he observes that ‘it took many minutes of scanning that section of the crowd with his zoom to actually spot her’, and that ‘in the process’ he picked up the ‘tearstained faces of adults, the elated, scant-toothed grins of toddlers, and young people’ (Egan 345). The impression Egan gives in describing Alex ‘scanning’ the crowd is, as Johnston correctly remarks, that of a society which has normalized constant surveillance. The problem with this, as John Lanchester explains, is that when ‘cameras in our cities’ are no longer ‘passive, but part of a connected network offering real-time surveillance and supervision’, people begin to both, knowingly and unknowingly ‘self-censor, self-monitor’ and ‘self-supervise’ (Lanchester 6). Hyper-surveillance therefore subconsciously affects the way people interact with urban space, and this is palpable with Alex at the Scotty Hausmann concert, who notes: ‘choppers were converging overhead, flogging the air with a sound [he] hadn’t been able to bear in the early years […] but [that] over time he’d gotten used to’ and that ‘their military cackle felt weirdly appropriate’ (Egan 339). Pankaj Mishra states that ‘Egan fully realises her vision of the impersonal tyranny of a mass, technicised society’ in A Visit from the Goon Squad, and indeed, the book highlights the way in which omnipotent figures, through surveillance and the resultant effect of ‘self-supervision’, are able to subliminally encourage people to interact with urban spaces in pre-determined ways (Mishra 27).\n The use of internet censorship and targeted media campaigns also informs and restricts where and when people choose to exist in cities. Lanchester points to the ‘Umbrella Protests’ in Hong Kong, as an example of how the Chinese government through the ‘systematic use of counter propaganda’ and ‘internet censorship’ was able to prevent protests on the streets in ‘mainland China’. He further explains how all of this technology ‘exists in the West’, but rather than being state controlled, it is ‘in the hands of private companies’, which exploit it to ‘make us click on ads and buy stuff’ (Lanchester 5, 9). In A Visit from the Goon Squad Egan similarly shows how powerful figures in the media industry like Bennie Salazar, use ‘sophisticated and ubiquitous forms of data collection’ to decide where and when individuals come into contact with urban spaces (Johnston 158). Indeed, Bennie says to Alex, ‘it’s not about sound anymore. It’s not about music. It’s about reach’; a clear acknowledgement that he intends to manipulate technology as a way of influencing how many people come to his outdoor performance (Egan 319). Bennie relies on Alex to use ‘parrots to create ‘authentic’ word of mouth for Scotty Hausmann’s first live concert’ (319, 322). The ‘parrot’ system is similar to what Lanchester describes with regards to the counter measures taken against the ‘Umbrella Movement’, in that it selects ‘influential and corruptible people’ amongst Alex’s ‘15, 896 friends’, who will be paid to promote Scotty Hausmann on web platforms, as a way of encouraging people to attend the concert (323). Mishra observes that Egan’s book leaves us with a ‘disturbing sense’ of the ‘unfreedom’ of its characters, and indeed, its lasting impression is that figures like Bennie and Alex, are able to control how people engage and interact with urban space (Mishra 29). This is confirmed when Alex acknowledges ‘that all of these people […] were on their way to hear Scotty Hausmann. Every single one’ and that ‘he’d done it, Christ he was a genius’ (Egan 338). Lanchester describes what happened with the ‘Umbrella Protests’ as a ‘autocratic fantasy, a posthumanist dream’, and Egan’s book similarly shows how the combination of technology and imposing leadership like Bennie and Alex’s, which is reflective of Moses, has dominated how people interact with urban space (Lanchester 6).\n In The Death and Life of Great American Cities Jacobs likens urban space to a dance, or in her words, ‘an intricate ballet’ where ‘individual dancers and ensembles all have distinctive parts which miraculously reinforce each other and compose and orderly whole’ (Jacobs 50). The experience of urban life is the product of this ideological position kept in balance by the attitude towards urban space represented by Robert Moses and Le Corbusier. Indeed, Hatherley gives evidence of this balancing act, explaining how in current society, most administrations attempt to ‘build like Moses with Jane Jacobs in mind’ (Hatherley 13). Using Zadie Smith’s White Teeth, this essay has attempted to elaborate on these two stances on urban space, which are so decisive in determining the way it is experienced. Indeed, Smith’s depiction of the Chalfens and the Iqbal family existing parallel to one another, reveal how Moses and Jacobs’ behaviorisms are prevalent in most cities – in this case London. In Benjamin Markovits’ You Don’t Have to Live Like This, however, an example is given of Detroit, as to what happens when this balance is tipped towards one side: settled communities, like Nolan’s, become uprooted because there is no requirement to compromise with the likes of Jacobs. And while Markovits’ novel hints at the role of technology in better facilitating the Moses approach towards urban development; it is Jennifer Egan’s A Visit from the Goon Squad, which fully throws into light the consequences of when despotic planning is given free rein in urban spaces through technological platforms. Twenty-first-century fiction then, in the time between Smith’s publication and more recently Markovits and Egan’s, has seen an increasing awareness in how technology has facilitated a Robert Moses inclined experience or urban life."

    text: "In The New York Times, the critic Josh Greenfield called Stanley Elkin ‘at once a bright satirist, a bleak absurdist and a deadly moralist’ (Grimes). The title of his short story ‘I Look Out for Ed Wolfe’ holds true to this observation in that it darkly ironizes the fact that no one in the entire narrative actually ‘look[s] out for Ed Wolfe’ (Elkin, 344). The character, an ‘orphan’ whose ‘orphan’s features were as true to himself as are their pale, pinched faces to the blind’ is motivated throughout most of the story by an impossible desire to determine his self-worth and make his presence felt. A likely consequence of his early neglect and position on the outskirts of society, where he exists in amongst ‘men desperately but imaginatively failing’ in life (338). Wolfe’s ‘want’ as Kurt Vonnegut puts it, becomes increasingly unattainable however as he complicates his self-worth with monetary value, and obsessively starts pawning off all of his possessions (Vonnegut 9). Elkin uses Wolfe’s struggle to overcome his own annihilation as the principal structuring device for his story; and as his attempts become increasingly futile, the story builds in tension until a point of climax is reached. In The Art of Fiction (1983) Gardner talks about the ‘famous Fichtean curve’ which he describes as a diagram which represents the ‘conflict situation’ in a short story. Absolutely necessary for establishing the moment of conflict is ‘exposition’ (Gardner 187). It is through the representation of Wolfe’s struggles to fulfil his desire, that Elkin creates his story’s exposition, and ultimately facilitates the tipping point, which Gardener outlines as the ‘climactic moment of recognition or understanding on the part of the central character’ (183). As mentioned, this arrives when Ed Wolfe realises he has failed to make himself felt, abandons his initial motivations, and embarks on an absurd rampage of drinking and spending.\n At the start of the story Elkin sets down the ground work for Ed Wolfe’s character, allowing the reader to comprehend the nature of his desire for self-definition, and the initial ways in which this is unattainable for him. The omniscient narrative tells us that Ed Wolfe ‘was an orphan’ and that ‘to himself, he seemed like one, looked like one’ (Elkin 338). Immediately, we are asked to see through Ed Wolfe’s eyes, and to think of the character how he thinks of himself: abandoned at birth and subsequently anonymous to the world. Indeed, he is described as giving off the impression of ‘ruthless isolation’ and the ‘peculiar dignity of men eating alone in restaurants on national holidays’ (338). The first insight we have into the fact Ed Wolfe desires to overcome his positionality at the outset of society, is that he ‘saved the photographs of strangers and imprisoned them behind clear plastic windows in his wallet’ (338). The bleak image of a man compensating for lack of real life connections by acquiring fictitious ones recurs throughout the story. Later on, for example, we see that he imagines a scene between himself and a piano playing Eddie, who says to him ‘Mistuh Wuf, you don’ wan’ heah dat ol’ song no maw’ (348). But perhaps most tellingly are Ed Wolfe’s efforts for self-improvement; the narrative describes how he ‘strove against himself, a supererogatory enemy, and sought by a kind of helpless abrasion, as one rubs wood, the gleaming self beneath’ (338). He strips himself down - quite literally later on in the story - in order to obtain some form of genuine or authentic personal value and worth, with which he can make his mark on the world. However, we are told that all these efforts are futile for Ed Wolfe, in the ‘sound of his own voice he detected the accent of the night school’, and he is forever unable to obtain ‘the fat, sunny ring’ of the real world (338). Elkin, from the story’s onset therefore establishes Ed Wolfe as a character who wants recognition, but who desperately fails in achieving it. The rest of the exposition is constructed by depicting Ed Wolfe’s struggles in this direction and against his self-erasure.\n The building where Ed Wolfe works is one such obstacle in the way of obtaining his desire, whether the character himself is aware of this or not. Like Wolfe, it exists at the point of other people’s indifference: the landlord has left the place in the hands of outcasts, ‘a strange band of entrepreneurs and visionaries’ which consists of ‘an eye doctor who corrected vision by massage’, ‘a black belt judo champion’ and a ‘radio evangelist’ (338, 339). Most importantly, however, is that Wolfe’s building is described as a place where people deal in the ‘artificial’, the ‘imitated’ and the ‘copied’ (339). What Wolfe desires, as has been established, is recognition and authentication in the real world. While he exists in this ‘outlaw’ building, however, it is impossible that he can obtain any genuine relationships, or self-authentication (338). The first interaction Wolfe has in the story is with Dr Brut, who appears almost like a manikin in the way that he is ‘framed in the arching golden nimbus of his inverted name on the window’ (339). The exchange is surreal, as Dr Brut awkwardly ‘holds him by the elbow’, embarks on a conversation that is brimming with cliché, and appears as if he is being ventriloquized by an absent figure (339). Elkin therefore creates the impression of Wolfe struggling against inauthenticity, and the specious characters which fill his place of work. Indeed, Dr Brut the supposed chiropractor, refers to the legitimate ‘doctors in hospitals, in clinics’ and ‘on boards’ as ‘the bastards downtown’; displaying a deep seated resentment against that which is acknowledged as real and genuine (339). This explains then, why the orphan Ed Wolfe rejects Dr Brut when he jovially suggests, in a half serious way: ‘I’ll adopt you […] we’ll open a clinic. C. Morris Brut and Adopted Son’. Ed Wolfe recoils at the proposition, saying ‘it’s something to think about’ before hurrying off to his offices in ‘Cornucopia Finance Corporation’ (339). Gardner explains that in the exposition, the writer must gradually authenticate his character’s dilemma in order to ‘actualize’ the climax (Gardner 186). Elkin, by representing Wolfe’s efforts to resist and overcome the superficiality of his work, is therefore placing an important expository point in his story which builds tension in anticipation of the climax. \n Having established Ed Wolfe as desperately on the peripheries of society, working in a block of offices brimming with counterfeiters, Elkin makes use of dialogue to further highlight the character’s desire for concrete recognition. James Wood explains the importance of dialogue in ‘carrying multiple meanings’ and how ‘we can tell a great deal from a character by how he talks, and whom he talks to, how he bumps up against the world’ (Wood 96). When Wolfe calls up Mr Flay, a struggling customer, the reader can see him immediately brighten at the opportunity for self-assertion; he turns the name of Cornucopia Finance into a sadistic jingle, ‘Can you cope, can you cope?’, before releasing a torrent of abuse at the man who has failed to pay his debts because he is ‘a little short’ of cash (Elkin 340). Ed Wolfe, as his boss La Meck later says, has a ‘real thing for the deadbeat soul’ and is almost an ‘artist’ in his ability to ‘take a guy who’s already down and bury him deeper’ (343). Indeed, he falls into a comfortable but ruthless groove when talking to Mr. Flay, and starts calling him ‘Warsaw’ because he detects that he is polish, and shouts down the phone: ‘You listen. You wanted the car. The refrigerator. The chintzy furniture. The sectional you saw in the funny paper. And we paid for it, right?’ (341). Elkin italicises the word ‘listen’, almost as if to emphasise Ed Wolfe’s desperation for his voice to be heard, to make himself known. The dialogue reveals what the omniscient narration previously has not; the extent to which Ed Wolfe is obsessed with overcoming his anonymity in the world, and his impassioned attempts at asserting his voice, in the form of perverse embittered phone calls. When Wolfe comes off the phone, we see he is exhilarated, and Elkin describes how ‘his chest was heaving’ and how he needed to ‘wipe his face’ (341). His struggle, however, is only just starting, and when he is fired by La Meck because Cornucopia Finance started ‘to get complaints’, Elkin skilfully introduces another barrier for Ed Wolfe to overcome: how to assert himself now without these phone calls (343). Again, by depicting moments of Ed Wolfe’s struggles, and complicating them further, Elkin is placing strain in his story and laying important groundwork for a moment of climactic release, when his protagonist realises he remains unacknowledged in life.\n When Ed Wolfe leaves Cornucopia Finance La Meck says to him ‘Look out for Ed Wolfe’, an articulation of what Elkin has been hinting at in the story up to this point: that Wolfe wants to become an anticipated and acknowledged figure (344). However, without his provisional means of achieving this - by lambasting those in significant debt – he is forced to find other ways to fulfil his ambitions. The solution becomes apparent when he sees the message on a ‘green slip’ that had been ‘shoved under the wiper blade’ of his car: ‘Your car will never be worth more than it is worth right now! Why wait for depreciation to make you automatically bankrupt. I will buy this car and pay you cash!’ (345). Wolfe applies the logic from the ‘green slip’ onto himself, believing that he personally will ‘never be worth more than’ he is now; leading to a bizarre process whereby he pawns off all his possessions for cash. Indeed, he ‘sadly’ contemplates ‘deprecation’, before quickly coming to the solution: ‘I’ll move. I’ll liquidate. I’ll sell out’ (348). As Wolfe begins this course of action, he becomes obsessed with the physical appearance of money, ‘hoping that the four hundred and sixty-three dollars and sixty-five cents’ he hands into the bank will appear ‘his week’s salary to the man who waited behind him’, and creates a quasi-monument out of a pile of a ‘thousand dollars’ on his ‘kitchen table’ (346, 347). The irony of the situation, however, is that by conflating self-worth with monetary value, Wolfe sets himself on a path of self-abrasion, which contrary to his desire, will ultimately lead to his complete anonymity and invisibility to the world. Elkin describes how ‘he sold and he sold, each day spinning of little pieces of himself, like controlled explosions of the sun’ (348). He phones up the book buyer, and sells his collection of over eleven hundred books, calling down the phone ‘I feel as if I’m selling my mind’ (349). This is quickly followed by his records, the ‘Folk. Classical. Broadway. Spoken World’, which prompts him to say ‘I feel as though I’m selling my ears’ (350). And when he moves onto selling his clothes, Elkin emphasises the extent to which Ed Wolfe has existed as an anonymous person, he tells the buyer ‘Those marginal restaurants where you can never remember whether they’ll let you in without a jacket? Well the jackets they lend you in those places always fit me’ (350). Ultimately, Elkin is building tension in his story by presenting the reader with Ed Wolfe’s desperate attempts at self-definition through financial means, and as his scheme of dispossession becomes increasingly hopeless, we are set in place for the story’s climactic tipping point.\n Indeed, with regards to the Fichtean curve, Gardener explains that if the writer has succeeded in building a series of moments of tensions in his exposition, and ‘the denouncement has been properly set up, it falls like an avalanche’ (Gardner 190). Having sold all his possessions, and contemplating: ‘that was what he was worth. That was the going rate for orphans in a wicked world. Something under $2, 500’, he becomes ‘restless’ and ‘panicky’ because he ‘had come to think of his money as his life’ and that ‘spending it was the abrasion again’ (353). On realising this Ed Wolfe reaches his point of crisis. He runs up to a desk clerk and asks desperately ‘Where’s the action?’, and when the clerk responds by looking ‘startled’, he goes up to a man reading The Wall Street journal and again asks, ‘Where’s the action?’ (354). The omniscient narrative tells us that Ed Wolfe ‘felt lousy, awkward, complicated irritated and ashamed’ and that looking at this man it suddenly ‘came to him how completely he had failed to make himself felt’ (355).\n Throughout the story the phrase ‘Look out for Ed Wolfe’ is uttered by Wolfe, a mantra which reminds him he needs to obtain his desire for recognition. The climactic moment in Elkin’s story comes when Wolfe is described saying: ‘Look out for Ed Wolfe, indeed’ (355). The variation of the phrase, to include the word ‘indeed’, emphasises the protagonist’s failure, and his recognition of this fact too. The final scene of the story follows Ed Wolfe and a man called Oliver, as they move to a club, where Wolfe becomes aggressive and psychotic as a result of his inability to achieve his ‘want’. Elkin presents Wolfe standing on a stage in front of a crowd of people, ironically in the limelight, to shouts of ‘Get down from there’, ‘shut up mister’ and ‘you’re a guest. A guest got no call to talk like that’ (361, 362). The exposition which Elkin has constructed by representing Ed Wolfe struggling to assert himself in the world, builds in tension throughout the story, and it is in these last scenes, when Wolfe meets Oliver, that a tipping point arises and collapses - when all Wolfe’s efforts fail, and we see that in reality, no one ‘look[s] out for Ed Wolfe’ (344).\n When Kurt Vonnegut writes that ‘Every character should want something, even if it’s only a glass of water’, he is highlighting the potential for a character’s desire to drive forward the narrative of a short story (Vonnegut 9). Indeed, in ‘I Look Out for Ed Wolfe’, it is clear that Elkin uses his protagonist’s ‘want’ - to establish his self-worth - as a means of fuelling his story’s overall narrative. The exposition is laid out through representations of the challenges Wolfe faces in achieving his desire: his birth as an orphan, his place at the edge of the legitimate world of work; and his attempts at overcoming them: acting as an aggressive debt collector, and eventually initiating a long process of dispossession, in hope of justifying through cash, his personal value. Having carefully constructed this ‘emotional line’ throughout the story, Elkin sets himself up perfectly for the climax (Gardener 187). In short then, establishing a dynamic whereby a central character struggles to fulfil his desire, is a distinctly effective way for a writer to hold together the overall plot of their short story."

    text: "In The Country and the City Raymond Williams suggests that as early as the Hellenistic period, the countryside has served as a useful comparison to the ‘internal corruption of the city’ (Williams 47). It has been elevated to mythic status, representing a ‘happier and more natural’ way of life (40). He further argues that the ‘idealization’ of the countryside has functioned fictionally as a reminder of an ‘essential morality’ which could be used to condemn or control the actions of those dwelling in the city (54). What is clear from Williams’ observations is that urban spaces are defined in constant relation to what exists outside the parameters of the city. In both The Twyborn Affair and Voyage in the Dark urban space is similarly characterized by ideas on peripheral space; in particular, conceptions of the countryside in Patrick White’s novel, and British colonies in the West Indies in Jean Rhys’. As such, the first section of this essay intends to reveal in more detail how people in the Australian city and its suburbs, construct themselves in accordance with ‘romantic notions of the redemptive and restorative qualities of nature’, and how those in London, as seen in Voyage in the Dark, determine their identity by measuring themselves against colonial outposts - such as those in the Caribbean (Murphy 122). It will then explore how White and Rhys undermine the binary structure based on this urban-periphery opposition, which excludes both Eddie Twyborn and Anna Morgan in the respective texts, from the social ontology that surrounds them. Ultimately, as Williams acknowledges in his book, that the countryside serves as a myth for those in the city; this essay will argue that White and Rhys’ literary depictions of the countryside and the colony, work to reveal the myth of peripheral space, and how, it is a fiction used to maintain order and normalcy in urban places. \n In The Twyborn Affair White depicts the Australian city and its suburbs as attempting to emulate the values and qualities thought to be found in the countryside. Andrew McCann sees the suburb in White’s novel – which this essay shall include in its understanding of an urban space – as ‘not a real place’ but a ‘fantasy of a place’, based around a utopian model where ‘romantic pastoralism and modern social engineering come together in a vision of harmony’ (McCann 58). Indeed, the Australian suburbs since their modern incarnation, were bound to aesthetic standards associated with nature, such as gardens and parks. But more importantly, as Graeme Davison points out, they were constructed around certain feminine tropes; in particular, fertility and nurture, due to conceptions of nature as feminine. He explains the suburban home thus became a ‘kind of temple in which the wife ruled as the ‘Angel of the Home’’ (Davison 3). Joanie Golson can be taken as representative of this nature inspired suburbia, where the woman is expected to be ‘feminine’ and a ‘doting wife’ (Lever). In part one of the novel, we see her looking through the window of a villa at Eudoxia Vatatzes, fantasizing about a life where she is not expected to play a gendered role: ‘she stood by the wall watching the scene through the open window, the tears streaming down her cheeks, for joy, from the music she was hearing, and out of frustration from the life she had led, and, it seemed would always lead’ (White 18). Joanie’s position – ‘by the wall’ – moving so as to get a better look at the ‘lithe young woman’, acts as a symbolic reminder to the reader, of her separation and exclusion from life outside of her gendered existence in the Australian suburb (17). At best she can be a voyeur, as in this instance, looking at Eudoxia; or she can dress up, as she remembers she had done with Eadie Twyborn, who had ‘given herself a moustache, dashed off with burnt cork’ (White 20). She can never live, however, outside of her prescribed life in the suburb, where she is expected to be both a wife and heterosexual. Indeed, Susan Lever has pointed out that Joanie creates Eudoxia ‘as a beautiful young woman, associated with gardens, flowers and music’ (Lever). In using the language of the suburbanite, ‘gardens’ and ‘flowers’ in her fantasies of escape, and what would be nefarious love, White further suggests the extent to which Joanie is conditioned by suburban ideas, and of nature as the aesthetic ideal. As such, the Australian suburb, and the behavior of its inhabitants, such as Joanie Golson’s can be seen as heavily influenced by ideas on peripheral space, in this instance, femininity and the aesthetics thought to be found in the natural world.\n In Rhys’ Voyage in the Dark London is similarly shown to define itself in relation to peripheral space; it creates a depraved image of the West Indies, and through comparison, asserts its morally superior character. Anna Snaith argues that urban space in the book is presented by Rhys as containing a ‘palimpsestic awareness of the space behind spaces’ (Snaith 76). Indeed, she shows that London cannot be understood, unless in relation to its colonial outposts, and throughout the book, we see the way in which people in the city overcome concerns regarding what it meant to be English in a time of ‘heightened national anxiety’, by establishing a picture of those in the colonies as ‘Other’ (79). When Anna Morgan describes to Walter Jefferies, where she is from, saying ‘I wanted to make him see what it was like’, detailing the ‘lovely moonlight nights’ where the ‘shadows the moon makes are as dark as sun-shadows’, his own preconceptions about the place prevent any real engagement (Rhys 42). While he acknowledges it may be ‘beautiful’, he ultimately says: ‘I don’t like hot places much. I prefer cold places. The tropics would be altogether too lush for me; I think’ (Rhys 42). For Jefferies, as Klaudia Lee explains, ‘heat’ is associated with ‘sexual lasciviousness’, and by maintaining that he would not like ‘hot places’, and that he prefers the ‘cold’, Jefferies is essentially insisting upon the moral superiority and purity of the English character over that of the Caribbean character (Lee 144). Almost everyone Anna comes into contact with, in fact, is quick to point out the ‘heat’ of the colonies, as if to foreground, the cool and rational qualities intrinsic to the English personality. In describing Anna, Maudie defaults to saying ‘she was born in a hot place’, only later followed by a more specific geographic location: ‘in the West Indies or somewhere, weren’t you, kid? (Rhys 8). The reliance on the colonies for those in the city to understand themselves, is perhaps better illustrated, however, in the prejudice Ethel displays against foreigners. She understands herself as the antitheses of the foreigner, even though she possesses many of the flaws which she ascribes to them. This irony is visibly rendered when Ethel says to Anna ‘I’m a Swedish masseuse … mind you … I don’t mean like some of these dirty foreigners’ (91). Ethel understands herself by creating a fiction in her head, that she is different from those who exists outside of the city, and in unfamiliar countries; a necessary function, as Lee says, for her maintaining ‘her self-proclaimed status of a lady’ (Lee 145). In short then, peripheral space, such as the colonies in the West Indies, allow for London and its inhabitants to find the contours of their identity. \n Having established that in both The Twyborn Affair and Voyage in the Dark urban identity is grounded by perceptions on peripheral space; it is important to examine the ways in which the two texts challenge this urban-periphery binary structure. McCann explains that a recurrent theme in Australian literature is its resistance to ‘suburban normalcy’ and indeed, White’s novel can be seen as an interrogation of the ‘semiotic and aesthetic’ components which organize the suburb (McCann 62). He breaks down the ‘clearly delineated sex roles’ and ‘signs’ on which the ‘suburban idyll’ depends, and exposes them to be arbitrary constructions which, this essay has argued, have been borrowed from ideals thought to be found in nature.  The themes of cross-dressing which exist throughout the novel, for example, are used by White to parody the signifiers of sexual identification, and to show the irrelevance of ‘gender iconography’ (Stobie 57). In part two of the book, Eddie Twyborn is dressed in Marcia Lushington’s clothes, when he is observed by her husband, who appears to say: ‘I just wanted to tell you, Marce, that the word was wrong- in the poem, I mean … he smiled, and immediately withdrew, not wanting to disturb his wife’s rest’ (White 283). Cheryl Stobie explains that ‘the effect of the masquerade may ensure that the subject passes’, and indeed, Greg Lushington is convinced that he is looking at his wife, ignorant to the fact it is Eddie Twyborn in drag. White thus highlights the way in which signifiers, such as dress, used to fix gender in place are, as Stobie argues, ‘mockable’ and largely an ‘artifice’ (Stobie 57). This categorization of gender is further collapsed by White in his presentation of Monsieur Pelletier, who takes to masturbating when he observes a figures in the sea: ‘unsure whether the stranger, a naked one at that, was a man or a woman’ (White 75). Desire, and sexual attraction, in this instance, cannot be ascribed to that which is purely physical, and we see Pelletier, regardless of the sex of the swimmer, relieved by ‘the trickle of his own cooling sperm’ (74). Stobie explains that White’s novel intends to ‘transgress the expectation of categories’ and suggest a ‘liminal space between confining roles’ (Stobie 57). Indeed, the book disrupts the normalcy and gender structures on which the Australian suburb is formed, and criticizes the absurdity of its rural aspirations. \n In Voyage in the Dark, in a similar way, Rhys exposes the problematic binary logic of colonial discourse, which leaves Anna – a creole person who is neither black or white, colonized or colonizer – unable to situate herself in both social and cultural terms. Adlai Murdoch argues that Anna is symbolic of the ‘proscriptive policies of the colonial neither/nor’ and the futility of its ‘performative planes’ (Murdoch 257). Indeed, having connections with both England and the West Indies, she belongs in reality to neither place, and throughout the book, there are no attempts made to accommodate her liminality. In maintaining the difference of the colonial figure as ‘Other’, people in urban spaces like London, depended on rigid binaries, and Anna’s ambiguity is therefore presented by Rhys posing a threat to English identity. Or, as Snaith suggests, Anna’s Caribbean affiliation ‘immediately excludes her from the category of Englishwomen’ (Snaith 81). In attempt to overlook her hybrid existence, Klaudia Lee argues Anna is constantly forced into the role of ‘cultural other who exists on sexual desire’ (Lee 144). She points to an example in the text when Jefferies takes her to a ‘semi-public space, the hotel room’ – where Anna is surprised to find a bedroom attached the room in which they have just dined (144). The example highlights that initially innocent when arriving in London, Anna is forced to play the role of the sexually-motivated colonial, which people in city expect and require of her. However, as White breaks down the urban-periphery binary with themes of cross-dressing, in The Twyborn Affair, Rhys similarly shows the ways in which these colonial systems are based on arbitrary constructs. She presents clothes and masquerade in the book as a way for Anna to achieve acceptance, or as Snaith points out, ‘dressing up’ becomes ‘a potential way out of her fixity’ (Snaith 81). While the purchasing of clothes represents for Anna both the possibility of change but also the impossibility, for she needs money to enact the material transformation; what is ultimately apparent is the way in which urban spaces define themselves according to a set of superficial standards, which are not grounded, as they might like to think, on the colonies as genuinely ‘Other’, but rather, on performative categories like dress.\n In both The Twyborn Affair and Voyage in the Dark ideas on peripheral spaces are further exposed as no more than imaginative creations. Like Williams explains in The Country and the City, that for those in urban places, there is a ‘mystification of the land’ which does not match up with the ‘rural exploitation’ and ‘instrumental’ treatment of men which actually defines the countryside. White and Rhys’ texts similarly highlight the fictitious nature of the ideals which are represented, for those in the city, by the countryside and West Indian colonies. While the Australian suburb is established around conceptions on the countryside as a ‘kindly mother earth, at once the source of life, of happiness, of wealth, and of power’ in The Twyborn Affair the opposite is shown to be true (Murphy 199). In part two of the book, when Eddie is working as jackeroo in rural Australia, the reader is presented with images of infertility and debauchery. Marcia Lushington, for example, has sexual relationships with Don Prowse and Greg Lushington which are defined by their infertile engagement - none of the children she has survive their infancy. Despite being described as ‘of the land’ by Prowse, her inability to mother a child, sets her apart from the ideal on which the Australian suburb is built, and which she is supposed to embody (White 187). In addition, the heteronormative relationships, and ‘rigidly monitored binarist system of gender and sexuality’ on which the suburb is centered, is shown to be lacking in the Australian countryside. Don Prowse, the farm manager, unable to control his sexual desires when he sees Eddie diving into the river, is drawn to rape him. The Australian suburb’s attempts to emulate the qualities and morals of the countryside are therefore shown by White to be an almost comical aspiration; indeed, it is far more likely that as peripheral space, the country has been fictitiously created, as a means of establishing a sense of ‘normalcy’ in the suburb, and set of moral standards. In Voyage in the Dark the West Indies are similarly created for practical purposes by those in the city, but these creations do not accurately reflect the place. Indeed, in reference to the climate with which the colonies are associated, Anna explains that ‘they exaggerate about the heat’ (Rhys 43). Perhaps more interestingly, however, is that when Anna arrives in London, she too uses the colonies functionally. She becomes nostalgic about the place, creating an image of it in her head, stating: ‘being black is warm and gay, being white is cold and sad’ (Rhys 10).\n Or as Snaith points out that ‘the sensuality she associates with Jamaica helps to free her from the mechanization of the metropole London’ (Snaith 84). In both The Twyborn Affair and Voyage in the Dark then, urban space can be seen as largely defined by ideas on peripheral space; but ultimately this space is a fictionally created – it is used to establish the identity of both, the Australian suburb, and metropoles like London."

    text: "In Modernist Fiction: An Introduction (1992) Randall Stevenson acknowledges the way in which modernist writing exhibits significant hostility towards clocks and the sense of temporality they represent. Joseph Conrad’s The Secret Agent (1907) is no exception to this, and in the novel, Chief Inspector Heat confronts ideas about the chronological clock, specifically remarking that there exist ‘unexpected solutions in continuity, sudden holes in space and time’. Heat’s views, more broadly, can be seen as literary reflections on the concerns raised in Henri Bergson’s Time and Free Will (1889) about the ways in which clocks and clockwork obscure the heterogeneous nature of individually experienced time, by dividing it ‘into equal portions’. Charlie Chaplin’s Modern Times (1936) similarly engages with these anxieties, and in its representation of the increased mechanisation of labour, it shows how the individual is forced to experience time, not as true to their consciousness, but rather, as Bergson says, something ‘measurable’ and ‘homogenous’. The first section of this article therefore intends to look more specifically at the ways Conrad and Chaplin’s work reveal the unease in the early twentieth-century about the demands placed on the individual by standardized time. It will then refer to Walter Benjamin’s The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction (1935) to assess how both The Secret Agent and Modern Times challenge conceptions of sequential time through experimentation in their respective mediums: Chaplin with filmic techniques, and Conrad by subverting the traditional structure of the novel. And finally, through an analysis of the satirical and comical components of both works, it will try to comprehend each writer’s stance on the potential for the individual to overcome the constraints of clock time. In short then, this article is an exploration into how literature and film of the twentieth century engages with Bergsonian notions of time; ultimately arguing that while Chaplin sees escape for the individual from mechanical time, Conrad is more affirmative about its dominance over both the individual and society.\n Bergson uses the term ‘pure duration’ in Time and Free Will to refer to how the individual experiences time internally. Not as linear, where time ‘takes the form of a continuous line or a chain, the parts of which touch without penetrating each other’, but rather, as an ‘organic whole’. By which he proposes that time, or ‘duration’, is formed when the ‘ego lets itself live’, past blends into present, and ‘a succession of qualitative changes […] melt into and permeate one another, without precise outlines’. In The Secret Agent Conrad suggests the industrial and economic developments of the early twentieth-century, which encouraged the systemization of time, pose an affront to ‘pure duration’ as Bergson describes it. Indeed, most of the characters in the book are presented as bound to the temporality of either their work or larger institutional systems. Winne and Verloc’s shop selling ‘nondescript packages’ and ‘photographs of more or less undressed dancing girls’, for example, exists in the liminal space between domestic and work life. The ‘door of the shop’ is described as ‘the only means of entrance to the house’ and a ‘bell’ which is hung on the door is used to summon Verloc, at any given moment, who ‘would issue hastily from the parlour at the back’ (14). Verloc and Winnie’s shop can almost be seen as a physical manifestation of the psychological state of the twentieth-century worker: permanently bound to the time pressures of working life, even when off-duty, and forced to submit to the sound of the ‘bell’ or ‘clock’ whose ‘precise hours’ Stevenson explains ‘had indeed become a kind of curse’. Perhaps a more affirmative suggestion in the book that systematic temporalities had merged into the personal, is Conrad’s constant referral to his characters as inanimate and material objects: the ‘clatter of the bell’ rings and ‘Mr Verloc obeyed woodenly, stony eyed, and like an automaton’. George Lukács mentions how the ‘qualitative’ nature of clock time encourages the worker to become ‘wholly separated from his total human personality’. And indeed, despite Verloc’s primary role as a government agent, a position suggesting autonomy, he is regardless presented by Conrad as dehumanised in having to mechanically attend the temporal pressures of his work.\n In Chaplin’s Modern Times a similar portrayal of sequential time imposing itself on the individual, is enacted by his famous on-screen character, the ‘Tramp’ (Chaplin). Bergson explains how clock-time almost creates a ‘second self […] which obscures the first, a self whose existence is made up of distinct moments’. In the famous sequence of Chaplin’s film, where the Tramp is consumed by the machinery he is working with, this ‘second self’ is comically rendered. Indeed, juxtaposed are the Tramp’s human habits – itching himself, talking to his overseer and becoming distracted with a bee – and the constant movement of the conveyor belt. The demands of his physical labour, force him to separate himself as Bergson says, into ‘distinct moments’ in order to oblige the machine, and he is thus prohibited from experiencing himself according to the actual duration of his conscious processes. When the president of ‘Electro Steel Corp’, demands: ‘section five speed it up’, the Tramp has no choice but to further adjust his time to the time of the machine. Inevitably, we see him become one with the inner mechanics, passing through it as if he himself is another cog. Chaplin therefore actualises the process whereby, as Lukács notes, ‘rational mechanization extends right into the worker’s soul’. The worker conforms to the systematic ticking of the clock, and the movement of the machine, forgoing any sense of psychological or personal time. Chaplin further exaggerates this imposition of clock-time on the working individual, by drawing parallels between factory and prison life. While at the prison, having been arrested on communist charges, the Tramp is subject to temporal regulation: marching to the eating chamber and back to the prison cell, with the ‘prison yard’ sign post lurking in the background as a further suggestion of the segmentation of time. This ordering of the individual according to the clock, familiar in penitentiary settings, shares similarities with the Tramp’s experience of the factory, where he is presented marching into work with the president watching his movements from a screen, like in a panopticon prison. Chaplin’s suggestion then, is clearly that the worker of the early twentieth-century, is forced to experience time, as would a prisoner: foreordained by bureaucratic systems, and not at all according to the Bergsonian notion of pure heterogeneous time. \n Having established that both The Secret Agent and Modern Times express anxiety about the effects of mechanical time on the individual; it is necessary to examine the ways in which their work is also an exploration on the potential for the literary and filmic mediums to challenge the chronology of the clock. Indeed, in Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction Benjamin comments on arts ability to make visible the reality of life: ‘our railroad stations and our factories appeared to have us locked up hopelessly. Then came the film and burst this prison-world asunder’. While Benjamin’s optimism for art’s role in representation was very much associated with film and the camera; in The Secret Agent, Conrad employs quasi modernist techniques in attempt to show more accurately, how psychological time operates. Indeed, Stevenson explains how the novel disrupts ‘chronology through the idiosyncrasies of characters’ inner consciousness’ and the amalgamation of ‘past and present, to incorporate earlier experience into present thought’. This technique occurs throughout the novel, but is perhaps most significantly felt when Verloc says to Winne: ‘You go to bed now. What you want is a good cry’. The words suggest that the two characters occupy the same space and time, but then Conrad presents us with Winnie’s deep reflections and conscious thoughts, allowing us to see how she experiences, in the room with Verloc, not sequential time, but psychological time. She reflects on her affection for Stevie, ‘brushing the boy’s hair and tying his pinafores’; the romance with a ‘young man’ who drifted away ‘while she averted her eyes tearfully’; and the relationship with Verloc, ‘security for Stevie loyally paid for on her part’. This past, as Stevenson correctly notes, comes flooding into the present: ‘A few seconds only had elapsed since the last word had been uttered’ by Verloc, and the effect is that a more complete representation of how time is experienced by the individual is represented. Gerald Genette uses the word ‘anachrony’ to refer to when narrative deviates from presenting the chronological order in which an event has occurred. He explains this is a valuable asset utilised in the novel, and indeed, in The Secret Agent it allows Conrad to manipulate time, and present it in a way that is less mechanical, but more true to the Bergsonian model. \n Benjamin’s concerns about the effects of increased mechanisation in the early twentieth-century are moderated by his optimism regarding new technology and its potential for facilitating artistic expression. Indeed, talking about the camera, he explains that ‘a different nature opens itself to the camera than opens to the naked eye – if only because an unconsciously penetrated space is substituted for a space consciously explored by man’. Indeed, in Modern Times Chaplin manipulates the camera’s technology in an attempt to curate an experience of time for the viewer that is not linear, but constantly modulating. Lawrence How suggests this is achieved through the editing of the film which forces a viewing ‘at a pace determined by the director’. For example, when the Tramp is in the back of a police car with the Gambit, a crash occurs, and in his presentation of the tilting car sharply contrasted with the image of the two figures lying on the floor, the viewer of the film is forced to accept the fracture in the narrative sequence, and prevented from experiencing the events of the film linearly. Elizabeth Yukins, talks about the ‘productivity of disharmony’, and ‘strategies to fragment and reconfigure the structure of linear narrative’ to ‘extend the representational possibilities of time’. Modern Times in its sharp editing of different scenes, therefore exemplifies Yukins’ ideas of structural reconfiguration. This is further achieved in the way in which the film ‘controls the audience’s gaze’. The camera, through the framing of scenes, and ‘it’s lowering and lifting’, bringing certain characters into focus, encourages the viewer to engage with their respective experiences of personal time (Benjamin). Having escaped the police car, the Gambit and the Tramp sit outside an idealized American bungalow; the camera moves to the Tramp, before entering into a dream sequence in which he and the Gambit have actualized the American dream. As the dream sequence ends, the camera moves left from the Tramp back to the Gambit, achieving what Conrad does to an extent in The Secret Agent, with Winnie’s anachronistic remembrance of the past: an insight into personal time. The technology of the camera is therefore utilised, as Benjamin says, to introduce ‘us to the unconscious optic as does psychoanalysis to unconscious impulse’. Modern Times can therefore be seen, as The Secret Agent can, an attempt to resist the chronological clock, and render time how the individual experiences it.\n While Conrad and Chaplin both engage with Bergson’s concerns about clock time, and pose challenges to it through the non-linear narratology of their work. The satirical and comic tone of their respective outputs, reveal different stances regarding the ability for the individual to escape the constraints of mechanized time. Glyn White talking about the role of comedy in the 1930s establishes two different comic forms: the ‘anarchistic comedy’, which ‘in a carnivalesque manner’ rejects ‘the constrictions of society, offering glimpses of more progressive visions of the future’, and the ‘affirmative comedy’, in which ‘the individual learns to negotiate with the requirements of society’. Conrad’s The Secret Agent can be productively compared to the affirmative comedy, in that it satirically shows there is no escape from mechanised society, and that the individual who attempts to resist it, will most likely be faced with some form of erasure. Indeed, Benjamin Lewis Robinson confirms that in the novel ‘the pervading sense is one of the hopelessness of all direction’. Verloc, and his supposed anarchists, are satirically presented as incapable of enacting any kind of change, with Heat saying he ‘could never bring himself to consider’ their activity ‘seriously’. And ultimately, when Stevie unknowingly attempts to blow up the Greenwich Observatory, Conrad notes it ‘did not show as much as the faintest crack’. The dark humor which underlines The Secret Agent, is therefore akin to the affirmative comedy in that Conrad reinforces that the individual has no choice but to ‘negotiate with the requirements of society’, and the clock time on which it is centered. On the other hand, Modern Times conforms to the ‘carnivalesque manner’ of the anarchist comedy, by confronting the ‘inhuman nature of mechanized work’ with slap-stick humour. Chaplin ridicules the machine, most specifically, when the Tramp is subjected to the ‘Billows feeding machine’, which is promoted by ‘the mechanical salesman’ as ‘a practical device which automatically feeds your men while at work’. The ineffectuality of the machine, when tested on the Tramp – throwing soup on his face –  is Chaplin’s attempt to undermine the notion that the human can be made to abide by mechanical time. And as White says, ‘glimpses of more progressive visions of the future’, are envisaged in the film when the Tramp and Gambit walk off into the distance with a mountain in the background; ‘at least they have each other’. As such, while Chaplin conforms to the anarchistic comedy, and offers an optimistic look at the potential for the worker to escape the pressures of clock time, Conrad, in his bleak satire, reflects on society’s unyielding grip on the worker, and how they experience time.\n In short then, the scepticism towards clock-time expressed by Inspector Heat in The Secret Agent can be taken as a useful point of departure for understanding literature and film’s engagement with the effects of systemised time on the individual in the early twentieth-century. Indeed, in both Conrad and Chaplin’s works concerns are raised with regards to the way in which an increasingly mechanised society imposes a homogenous and regulated system of time, as symbolized by the clock, onto its workers. An encroachment on the psychological ‘duration’, which Bergson in his Time and Free Will, explains that the individual normally experiences. And while both Modern Times and The Secret Agent employ literary and filmic devices to challenge ideas of chronology, reflecting Benjamin’s optimism for artistic expression in the ‘age of mechanical reproduction’. This article has ultimately intended to show that Chaplin, in his comical rendering of the individual in amongst machines differs from Conrad, who is affirmative that there is no relief from the ticking of the clock."

    text: "Sarah’s Hawke’s crochet garments are amazingly complicated, full of patterns and colours which, with the amount going on, should look chaotic, but instead they are pieces of technical harmony. Growing up in Ramsgate, her relationship with crochet started one summer when she was faced with the choice of either spending money on clothes or going out with her friends. She tells us “it was like one or the other, and I chose going out and drinking with my friends. If I wanted to go to the beach I had to think really creatively about what I was going to wear and that’s when I picked up crocheting”. Seeing crochet bikinis in shop windows, she thought “yeah I can do that”, watched a couple of tutorials and “picked it up from there”. Getting her first crochet needle from a haberdashery on the highstreet, she says that her initial projects “always focused on the end product” rather than the creative process, and that more or less, she copied directly from the youtubers she was watching.\n So when we ask her what her creative turning point was (clearly she is no longer limited to reproductions) she says, “do you remember the Gucci balaclavas that came out a couple of years ago, they were really cool? Rhianna wore like a Gucci balaclava with like big earrings in the side and obviously she looked fucking stunning. My friend sent me that and was like ‘can you make me something like this’ and I was like shit I can try”. It was getting to grips with the technicalities of making balaclavas that started encouraging Sarah to think more inventively about crochet and to explore the different materials she could use to ensure that they didn’t just look like a “sack around a head”. “Once I got comfortable with the different stitches, she adds “I could kind of go on to my own path and find inspiration and really experiment”.\n No longer a novice, but a visibly talented crocheter, Sarah’s work has caught the attention of music artists like Summer Walker, who requested to pull her collection for a video project she was working on back in 2019. While the technicalities of transporting lovingly crafted garments across the Atlantic on a three day notice meant that the project didn’t come to fruition, her work has featured more recently in the music videos of R&B artist The Only Samba and the music hall group, Sun Divas. Her collaborations, predominantly with fashion students, have also continued to push her on a technical level. Asked to design the headwear for a shoot which she describes as “kind of like 1950s housewife meets alien who doesn’t really understand what it’s like to be a 1950s housewife” Sarah stitched hundreds of crocheted Afghan flowers onto a basic balaclava; a project she describes as “really technical” but that got her “a lot of kudos from the crochet community”.\n Speaking about other crochet artists that have inspired her, Sarah paints a picture of a really supportive network. “A lot of people will feed off each other’s ideas” and “whenever there are newcomers that are trying out interesting patterns, people who have been in it since day dot will always reshare their work”. More simply she adds, “there’s always a bit of collaboration in that sense that crocheters fan girl other crocheters”. A great illustration of this community was when she lived in Herne Hill and an old lady living in her block of flats saw her crocheting in the communal garden and invited her up, showing her a room with “hundreds of crochet needles in little pots, a book case which was like floor to ceiling full of crochet books, yarn and more needles... the ultimate work space for a crocheter”. After a cup of tea, she gave Sarah a hand knitted jumper with brown writing on it saying ‘this is an original hand knitted top’. ‘I was like fuck this must have taken so long” but accepted because it fitted “perfectly... obviously” she laughs.\n Sarah’s journey into crochet, however, hasn’t been all smooth sailing. Getting her head around the business side of things, she admits, has been a difficult process. “I still undersell myself. I am really bad at the admin. I won’t time myself, really. I used to look at what I’d been working on at the end and think that maybe took me 20 hours to do and if I want to pay myself London living wage, that’s basically like 200 quid, but I’d still end up knocking off 50 quid, which is really dumb”. Now, she says, she is better at pricing her work. “People will message me all the time and be like oh I love this top, how much is it? And I’ll be like the top is 50 quid, and not really budge from there”. She says “that’s the cost of a crochet item”, but when “you get stuff like all the fast fashion labels that are like selling crochet items for £3 for a skirt in sale” it makes it difficult to compete with. We ask whether this makes her pessimistic for her future projects, but she says “nah, I think you’ve just got to be able to market it in the right way, there are people who understand the value of it more and are not underselling it”.\n In her latest project, she has been working on some baker boy hats in collaboration with another artist looking into black british identity, which has been immensely satisfying. She explains “people have started putting the power more in my hands, making me feel more like an artist and designer rather than someone who just crochets like a machine”."
