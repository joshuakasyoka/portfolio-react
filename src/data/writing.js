      text: "Rob Nixon suggests that we live in ‘an era of enclaved time wherein for many speed has become a self-justifying, propulsive ethic that renders ‘uneventful’ violence … a weak claimant on our time’ (Nixon 8). As such, he argues ‘one of the most pressing challenges of our age is how to adjust to our rapidly eroding attention spans’, and prevent representations of conflict, which for one reason or another, fail to catch our attention (8). Indeed, images and stories of atrocity, are increasingly viewed with a passivity that is the consequence of over exposure, and a lack of expected engagement on the part of the reader and viewer. Sontag has expressed: ‘images of suffering endured in war are so widely disseminated now that it is easy to forget how recently such images became what is expected from photographers of note’. How then, is conflict and trauma represented, when the audience it is intended for, is characterised by a distinct inability to react, and a ‘compassion’, which ‘stretched to its limits, is going numb’ (Sontag). Marianne Hirsch and Linda Hutcheon both point towards comics as a medium which, in its existence at ‘the borders between the pictorial and the linguistic’, and the crossroads of different genres, demands reader participation and comprehension. The relationship between word and image in graphic novels, is not always seamless or complementary, and indeed, often demands critical engagement. Hirsch says that ‘words, images, and word-images’ placed together in graphic texts ‘enact the impossibility of seeing and the impossibility of not looking’, and that by asking ‘us to read back and forth’ they reveal ‘the materiality of words and the discursivity and narrativity of images’ (Hirsch 120). In Maus then, the relationship between image and text is used by Spiegelman to engage the reader with the plurality and constructedness of narrative accounts on the Holocaust. And in The Photographer and Palestine, words, photographs, and graphics, are juxtaposed in a parodic way, so as to encourage reader scrutiny in the narritavising of others’ stories. In short, this chapter intends to explore the ways in which ‘visual-verbal biocularity’ works to facilitate reader participation in narrative, and prevent the desensitization which has come to define representations of conflict (120). In The Politics of Postmodernism (1989) Hutcheon explains how ‘text/image combinations work to point to the coded nature of all cultural messages. They do so by overtly being re-visions: they offer a second seeing, through double vision, wearing the spectacles of irony’ (123).  Indeed, looking at the relationship between word and image, in reference to Roland Barthes, Hutcheon notes how ‘the addition of a linguistic message’ to a photograph or image, can either function as an ‘anchorage’ or a ‘relay’. Using the term anchorage, she implies a process whereby words or text can ‘fix’ an image, and ‘guide identification or interpretation’. But alternatively, she looks at how ‘the verbal in combination with the visual’ can ‘create a situation where there is double meaning and contradiction’, or what Barthes terms ‘relay’ (125). In comics, we sometimes see this latter relationship between word and image, and ‘above all’ the medium works to ‘de-naturalize the relation between the visual and the verbal and also any evaluative privileging of one over the other’ (125). Indeed, the contradiction between word and image, or the concept of ‘double vision’, is importantly used by Spiegelman in Maus to engage the reader with questions of representation, explicitly asking them to make judgements about the visual and verbal choices in the text for themselves. One obvious example of this is when Artie is questioning his father’s testimony that there was no orchestra playing as prisoners marched out of Auschwitz. The verbal account begins: ‘I just read about the camp orchestra that played as you marched out the gate’, to which Vladek responds: ‘An orchestra? … No. At the gate I heard only guards shouting’ (Spiegelman 214). While the reader would normally expect Spiegelman’s visual narrative to comply with the witness testimony; in the adjacent frames, we see a depiction of the orchestra, with marching prisoners, and another frame in which the prisoners cover the orchestra, except from the fingerboard of the cello, and the top of the conductor’s baton. Spiegelman wants to highlight that his father’s account of the Holocaust is not the only version of events, and that ‘it’s very well documented’, that there was an orchestra in Auschwitz. As such, he visualizes both versions of events, leaving the reader in a position in which they have to construct which narrative they wish to take forward (214). In an interview Spiegelman states that ‘instead of making comics into a narcotic, I’m trying to make comics that can wake you up, like caffeine comics that get you back in touch with things that are happening around you’ (Silverblatt 31). Through his presentation of this ‘double vision’, whereby the verbal narrative contradicts the visual medium, Spiegelman thus encourages the reader to make choices, and engage with the construction of the text. This participatory model of reading, is facilitated by visual-verbal hybridity, and indeed, prevents a reading response which is detached from the events being depicted Scott McCloud further comments on the interaction between different semiotic modes in comics, saying the overlap between the visual and verbal casts the reader into a space which exist in ‘the limbo of the gutter’, and where ‘a kind of magic’ happens that ‘only comics can create’ (McCloud 66, 92).  Indeed, it has often been observed that when reading a comic, the reader takes the words and images on the page and fuses them together to create their own particular narrative. Spiegelman, in an interview articulates this feature, saying: ‘I didn’t want people to get too interested in the drawing. I wanted them to be there, but the story operates somewhere else. It operates somewhere between the words and the idea that’s in the pictures and in the movement between the pictures’ (Brown 104).  As such, visual-verbal hybridity in comics, forces the reader into a position, in which they have to construct the series of historic and traumatic events in their own head, and are prevented from a superficial engagement. In order to achieve this effect in Maus, Spiegelman strips down the visual panels in his story to their bare essentials, presenting the reader with figures, whose expressions are conveyed in relatively few lines, and settings, in which a sense of place is constructed using minimal detail; like the small dotted wallpaper to convey the period. And verbally, Spiegelman says, he had to ‘distill’ his father’s accounts ‘to keep the phrases that are most telling’ (Brown 96). This economic approach to using words and image on the page, forces the reader to participate in the process of narrative reconstruction independently, or as McCloud says, it encourages the ‘phenomenon of observing the parts but perceiving the whole’ (McCloud 63). Andreas Huyssen explains this imaginative participation is what lead to the success of Peter Weiss’ post-war play about the Holocaust, The Investigation (1965). He says: ‘Auschwitz is not shown on stage; it is recreated through the memory of the accused, the witnesses and survivors who confront each other a second time in the courtroom trying to testify and to articulate what happened another time at another place’ (Huyssen, The Politics of Identification 131). In a similar way to the graphic novel, Weiss’ play refuses a representation of the tragedy of Auschwitz in a complete visually digestible way, instead it asks the viewer, or audience, to construct for themselves, through hearing the memories ‘of the accused’, the events, imaginatively on their own terms. Claude Lanzmann’s Shoa (1985), a much praised film dealing with the events of the Holocaust, must also be referenced here. The film is ‘made exclusively of testimonies: first-hand testimonies of participants in the historical experience of the Holocaust, interviewed and filmed by Lanzmann’, and ‘in contrast to its cinematic predecessors on the subject, it refuses systematically to use any historical, archival footage’ (Felman 205). As such, the audience is asked to engage in the process of the reconstruction of events imaginatively themselves, and encouraged to contemplate questions on the limits of visual representation, and what it means to engage with the suffering of others. While Maus offers a visual as well as a verbal account of the events of the Holocaust, and is therefore not completely comparable with Shoa or The Investigation, the overlap between image and text, forces the reader into a space in which they too are partly responsible for constructing the events. Indeed, Hutcheon says that Maus creates a ‘fictive heterocosm, a complete visual and verbal universe’, and as such, the reader is forced into a position where they are required to participate in this ‘universe’, and prevented from a desensitization to the suffering of others (Hutcheon, Postmodern Provocation 301). With further regard to word-image relationships, Hutcheon observes that when there is friction between the two, we sometimes see, what she terms ‘parodic intertextuality’ (Hutcheon, The Politics of Postmodernism 61). Or that, ‘the clashing of various possible’ narrative discourses (word and image) creates a ‘parodic’ situation, which challenges the reader’s ‘assumption of the seamlessness’ of narrative, and asks us to ‘question the process by which we represent’ (53). Indeed, in this sense, as she rightly points out, ‘postmodern parody is both deconstructively critical and constructively creative, paradoxically making us aware of both the limits and the power of representation’ (98). Its ‘constructively creative’ use can be seen especially well in Sacco’s Palestine, where he juxtaposes visual with verbal, to create parodic situations in his narrative, in which the reader is forced engage with the constructedness of his portrayal of others’ stories. In Ways of Seeing (1972) John Berger explains that ‘the meaning of an image is changed according to what one sees immediately beside it or what comes immediately after it’ (Berger 29). Throughout Sacco’s text, there are moments where he presents a panel, signifying one thing to the reader, but then sharply undermines or contradicts this through his verbal narration. As such, he changes the meaning of the image, as Berger argues, is a vulnerability of the visual medium, but he also creates a parodic situation, where the reader is forced to question his narrative authority. One particular example of this is when Sacco is in a hospital ward, and he sees a mother at the bedside of her injured son. The verbal narration says: ‘Ask her if I can take his picture’, to which the mother’s response is: ‘‘No’ in Arabic’ (Sacco 32). The visual frames presented, however, directly oppose the verbal, and laid across the page are two vivid graphic renditions of the injured son, teeth clenched together in pain. Considering how much Sacco uses photographic evidence for his non-photographic drawings – Katalin Orbán says ‘he relies on photos for the authentic recreation of scenes’ -  we can assume that he took the photograph of the injured boy, disobeying the mother (Orbán 131). The visual and verbal therefore clash, as Hutcheon says is typical of postmodern parody, and the effect is that the reader is forced to linger on the narrative account given by Sacco and subject it to criticism. As such, the reader participates in the process by which the narrative account is brought into being, and are far less likely to overlook, as Nixon explains is typical of representation of violence, the suffering of others. In the whole of Palestine, there is only one full page-spread not accompanied by verbal narration. Berger explains in relation to paintings unaccompanied by words, that they ‘are silent and still in a sense that information never is’ (Berger 31). Sacco’s inclusion of this one un-narrativised drawing, can be seen as a reminder of how powerfully his words influence the images in his story, and again, how as the reader, we should be constantly critical of where word and image meet to convey meaning. In The Photographer too, Orbán notes how ‘parodic-intertextuality’ encourages reader engagement with the narrative presented by Lefèvre (Hutcheon, The Politics of Postmodernism 61). She says: ‘the reading process is a very dynamic sequence of dizzying displacements’ and that ‘panelized contact strips significantly shift the logic of organization, status, and mode of viewing’ (Orbán 133). Indeed, the use of photographic, graphic and verbal narration, all interweaving with one another, prevent a seamless reading of events, but instead form an ordered chaos, laid out on the page, which the reader is required to make sense of. Thus, while Nancy Pedri looks at the relationship between word and image in The Photographer, saying ‘that which the photographs present visually restates and expands upon the verbal text’ and in this way ‘the two work together as equal partners in the creation of meaning’ (Pedri 17). It is more the case, that while words contextualize, and provide the images with definition (as explained in chapter one), this not an immediately intuitive process, but requires work and multimodal forms of reading. For example, having been invited to have a look at an injured girl who ‘hasn’t gotten up since the bombing’, Lefèvre provides the reader with a detailed verbal narrative account of the girl’s injuries, he says: ‘There’s no apparent wound. No Blood’ but ‘that little dot, there … that means she’ll never walk again’ (Lefèvre 134, 135). Due to the darkness of the room, however, Lefèvre doesn’t take any photographs, all the reader is left to observe, is graphic panels which depict the silhouettes of figures surrounding the little girl in the dark. And, in the later frames, when the girl has been taken out on a stretcher, the reader still, is only presented with photographs of a group of people, but never an image of the girl herself. As such, the reader is placed in a position, in which they have to thread together the disharmonious verbal narrative with the photographic, and non-photographic panels, to create for themselves, a rounded picture of the injuries which Lefèvre describes. The visual and verbal in this situation, do not match up, and the reader is left with a parodic situation, in which they have to tie the different mediums together in a logical way, thus personally contributing to the narratavising of the paralyzed girl’s story. Hutcheon says that the ‘conjunction of text and image raises new questions’ about representation in postmodern literature, and indeed, in The Photographer, we see how the two, in juxtaposition to one another, encourage and facilitate reader participation in the conflict experienced by others.In reference then, to what Sontag and Nixon say with regards to an increasing desensitization towards images and stories of conflict due to ‘rapidly eroding attention spans’ (Nixon 3). This chapter has endeavored to show that the graphic novel, in the way that it combines both word and image demands a form of reading that is not complacent, but rather constructive and participatory. Indeed, the reader of the graphic novel is required to imaginatively create for themselves, in the ‘space between’ panels, a fuller account of the events described by the narrator using visual and verbal means.  And furthermore, as shown in relation to The Photographer and Palestine, when image and text clash, and form ‘friction’, the reader is asked to enquire into the process of narrative construction itself. The ultimate effect, is that visual-verbal hybridity prevents the representation of others’ suffering that is easily overlooked."
