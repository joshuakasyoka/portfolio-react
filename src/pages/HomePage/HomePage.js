When I was a child I would spend hours on end building puppets and sets for stop-motion animations, convincing myself I was the next Tim Burton. Over the years this little penchant of mine has taken many forms, from book-binding to wood-turning, but throughout, one thing has remained unchanged: my passion for designing and creating. I had a BIG realisation a few years ago that the most exciting things being made werenâ€™t material objects like a stool or a lamp, but websites, and online platforms which responded to, and tackled a whole bunch of social issues." image1={ImageFive} image2={AltImageFive} link="/about"></AboutMe>
